<br>
By the very edge of the blue sea<br>
lived an old man and his old woman.<br>
For three and thirty years they had lived<br>
in a tumbledown hut made of mud.<br>
The old man caught fish in his fishing net;<br>
the old woman span with her spinning wheel.<br>
One day the old man cast his net<br>
and all he caught in his net was slime.<br>
The old man cast his net a second time<br>
and all he caught in his net was weed.<br>
A third time the old man cast his net <br>
and what he found in his net was a fish —<br>
no ordinary fish, but a golden fish.<br>
The fish begged, the fish begged and implored;<br>
the fish prayed in a human voice:<br>
'Release me, set me free in the sea —<br>
and in return you'll receive a grand ransom,<br>
I'll grant you whatever you wish.'<br>
The old man was amazed and frightened.<br>
<br>
Three and thirty years he had fished — <br>
and not once had he heard a fish talk.<br>
He returned the fish to the water,<br>
saying gently as he let her go free,<br>
'God be with you, golden fish!<br>
I don't need your grand ransom.<br>
Off you go — into the deep blue sea!<br>
Swim free, swim where you wish!'<br>
<br>
The old man went back to his old woman<br>
and told her of this great wonder:<br>
'Today I caught a fish in my net —<br>
no ordinary fish, but a golden fish.<br>
The fish spoke, she spoke in our tongue;<br>
she begged to go home, into the blue sea.<br>
she promised me a splendid ransom;<br>
she said she would grant whatever I wished.<br>
But I didn't dare take this ransom.<br>
I set her free in the deep blue sea.'<br>
The old woman scolded her old man:<br>
'Simple fool, fool of a simpleton!<br>
What stopped you taking this ransom?<br>
A mere fish — and you were too frightened!<br>
You could at least have got a new washtub.<br>
Ours is cracked right down the middle.'<br>
<br>
Off he went towards the blue sea.<br>
(The blue sea looked a little troubled.)<br>
He called out to the golden fish<br>
and the fish swam up and asked him,<br>
'What is it, old man, what do you want?'<br>
The old man bowed to the fish and said,<br>
'Have mercy on me, Sovereign Fish.<br>
My old woman is cursing and scolding me.<br>
Though I am old, she gives me no peace.<br>
She needs a new washtub, she says.<br>
Ours is cracked right down the middle.'<br>
The golden fish replied straightaway,<br>
'Take heart — and God be with you!<br>
Outside your hut you'll find a new washtub!'<br>
The old man went back to his old woman.<br>
His old woman now had a new washtub,<br>
but she was cursing more fiercely than ever:<br>
'Simple fool, fool of a simpleton,<br>
all you got from the fish was a washtub.<br>
What wealth can be found in a washtub? <br>
Get on back, you fool, to the fish.<br>
Bow down to the fish and say<br>
you want a handsome house built of wood.'<br>
<br>
Off he went towards the blue sea.<br>
(The blue sea was a little rough.)<br>
He called out to the golden fish<br>
and the fish swam up and asked him,<br>
'What is it, old man, what do you want?'<br>
The old man bowed to the fish and said,<br>
'Have mercy on me, Sovereign Fish.<br>
My old woman is cursing and raging.<br>
Though I am old, she gives me no peace.<br>
She wants a handsome house built of wood.'<br>
The golden fish replied straightaway,<br>
'Take heart — and God be with you!<br>
You shall have your house built of wood.'<br>
The old man set off for his hut,<br>
but not a trace of his hut could he find.<br>
In its place stood a house built of wood<br>
with a whitewashed brick chimney<br>
and two strong gates hewn from oak.<br>
Sitting by the window was his old woman,<br>
swearing at him for all she was worth:<br>
'Simple fool, fool of a simpleton,<br>
all you got from the fish was a house.<br>
Get on back, you fool, to the fish.<br>
I don't want to be a lowly peasant.<br>
I want to be a noble lady.'<br>
<br>
Off he went towards the blue sea.<br>
(The blue sea was not calm.)<br>
He called out to the golden fish<br>
and the fish swam up and asked him,<br>
'What is it, old man, what do you want?'<br>
The old man bowed to the fish and said,<br>
'Have mercy on me, Sovereign Fish.<br>
My old woman is shouting and swearing,<br>
cursing me for all she is worth.<br>
Though I am old, she gives me no peace.<br>
She doesn't want to be a lowly peasant.<br>
She wants to be a noble lady.'<br>
The golden fish replied straightaway,<br>
'Take heart — and God be with you!'<br>
<br>
The old man went back to his old woman<br>
and saw? He saw a tall mansion.<br>
His old woman was standing there in the porch.<br>
She was wearing a splendid 'soul-warmer' — <br>
a precious waistcoat trimmed with sable.<br>
On her head was a brocade head-dress;<br>
round her neck hung heavy pearls<br>
and gold rings encircled her fingers.<br>
On her feet were fine red boots<br>
and before her stood zealous servants;<br>
she was slapping them and pulling their hair.<br>
The old man said to his old woman,<br>
'Good day, Lady Countess Baroness!<br>
I hope you've got all you want now!'<br>
The old woman flew at her husband<br>
and packed him off to work in the stables.<br>
<br>
A week passed, and another week.<br>
The old woman grew madder than ever.<br>
She sent her old man back to the fish:<br>
'Go back to the fish, bow low and say<br>
I don't want to be a fine lady —<br>
I want to be a mighty tsaritsa.'<br>
The old man took fright. He implored her:<br>
'What's got into you, woman? Are you crazy?<br>
Have you been eating black henbane?<br>
You don't know how to walk like a tsaritsa,<br>
You don't know how to talk like a tsaritsa.<br>
You'll be the laughing stock of your tsardom.'<br>
The old woman flew into a fury.<br>
She struck her husband across the cheek:<br>
'How dare you, peasant, answer me back?<br>
How dare you talk like that to a lady?<br>
Back you go again to the sea — or, upon my word,<br>
You'll be dragged there against your will.'<br>
<br>
Off he went towards the blue sea.<br>
(The blue sea was blacker than black.)<br>
He called out to the golden fish<br>
and the fish swam up and asked him,<br>
'What is it, old man, what do you want?'<br>
The old man bowed to the fish and said,<br>
'Have mercy on me, Sovereign Fish.<br>
My old woman is raging again.<br>
She doesn't want to be a fine lady.<br>
She wants to be a mighty tsaritsa.'<br>
The golden fish replied straightaway,<br>
'Take heart — and God be with you!<br>
Your old woman shall be a tsaritsa.'<br>
<br>
The old man went back to his old woman.<br>
Before him stands a splendid palace<br>
and his old woman is there in the hall.<br>
She is a tsaritsa sitting at table.<br>
Nobles are standing and waiting on her,<br>
pouring her wines from over the seas<br>
while she nibbles on honeycakes.<br>
All around stand fierce-looking guards<br>
with sharp axes poised on their shoulders…<br>
The old man was frightened. He bowed to the ground<br>
and said, 'Greetings, O dread Tsaritsa —<br>
and I hope you've got all you want now!'<br>
The old woman didn't look at him;<br>
she just ordered him out of her sight,<br>
and her nobles and courtiers came running<br>
and shoved the old man towards the door;<br>
and the guards ran up with their axes<br>
and all-but hacked him to pieces.<br>
and everyone laughed at the old man:<br>
'Serves you right, you ignorant lout!<br>
Let this be a lesson to you, bumpkin!<br>
Don't get too big for your boots<br>
or sit in another man's sleigh!'<br>
<br>
A week passed, and another week.<br>
The old woman grew madder than ever.<br>
She sent her courtiers to fetch her husband.<br>
They found him and brought him before her<br>
and the old woman said to her old man,<br>
'Go back, bow down to the fish.<br>
I don't want to be a mighty tsaritsa,<br>
I want to be a sea empress;<br>
I want to live in the Ocean-Sea<br>
with the golden fish as my servant<br>
to bring me whatever I ask for.'<br>
<br>
The old man did not dare say a word;<br>
he was too frightened to open his mouth.<br>
Off he went towards the blue sea.<br>
Raging there was a black storm!<br>
Waves were flinging up spray;<br>
angry waves were crashing and howling.<br>
He called out to the golden fish<br>
and the fish swam up and asked him,<br>
'What is it, old man, what do you need?'<br>
The old man bowed to the fish and said,<br>
'Have mercy on me, Sovereign Fish!<br>
What am I to do with the wretched woman?<br>
She no longer wants to be a tsaritsa,<br>
she wants to be a sea empress.<br>
She wants to live in the Ocean-Sea<br>
with you as her faithful servant<br>
to bring her whatever she asks for.'<br>
Not a word did the fish reply.<br>
She just slapped her tail on the water<br>
and dived deep into the blue sea.<br>
The old man waited and waited<br>
But that was all the answer he got.<br>
He went back — to a hut made of mud.<br>
His old woman was sitting outside it;<br>
And before her lay a broken washtub.<br>
<br>
