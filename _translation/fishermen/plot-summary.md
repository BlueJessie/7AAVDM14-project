There once lived an old man and his good-wife on the shore of the deep blue ocean; They lived <br>
in a tumble-down hovel for thirty-three summers and winters. The old man used to fish for his living, <br>
and his wife spun yarn on her distaff. He once cast his net in the ocean, and pulled it up with mud <br>
from the bottom; He again cast his net in the ocean, and this time caught nothing but seaweed; <br>
When he cast his net for the third time, one fish was all that he landed, No common fish, though, <br>
but a goldfish. Now the goldfish began to implore him, and it spoke like a real human being:<br>
<br>
"Put me back, old man, into the ocean. <br>
	I will pay you a right royal ransom,<br>
	I will give you whatever you ask me."<br>
<br>
The old man was astonished and frightened - He'd been fishing for thirty-three summers, bat had not <br>
heard of any fish talking. So with care he untangled the goldfish and tenderly said as he did so:<br>
<br>
	"God bless you, my dear little goldfish!<br>
	Thank you kindly, I don't want your ransom.<br>
	Go back to your home in the ocean,<br>
	And roam where you will without hindrance."<br>
<br>
To his wife the old fisherman hastened to tell her about this great marvel.<br>
<br>
"I caught only one fish this morning -<br>
	A goldfish it was, most uncommon;<br>
	It spoke like a Christian, and begged me<br>
	To put it back into the ocean,<br>
	And promised to pay a rich ransom,<br>
	To give me whatever I asked for.<br>
	But how could I ask for a ransom?<br>
	I released it without any payment."<br>
<br>
His wife started scolding her husband:<br>
<br>
	"Oh you simpleton! Oh yon great silly!<br>
	Couldn't make a mere fish pay a ransom!<br>
	You at least might have asked for a wash-tub -<br>
	For ours is all falling to pieces!"<br>
<br>
The old man returned to the seashore, where the blue waves were frolicking lightly. <br>
He called out aloud for the goldfish, and the goldfish swam up and demanded:<br>
<br>
	"What is it, old man, you are wanting?"<br>
<br>
With a bow, the old man said in answer:<br>
<br>
	"Forgive me, Your Majesty Goldfish!<br>
	My old woman has scolded me roundly-<br>
	Won't leave me alone for a minute,<br>
	She says that she wants a new wash-tub,<br>
	For ours is all falling to pieces."<br>
<br>
The goldfish murmured in answer:<br>
<br>
	"Do not worry, go home, God be with you -<br>
	Very well, you shall have a new wash-tub."<br>
<br>
To his wife the old fisherman hastened, and behold - there it was, the new wash-tub. <br>
But she scolded him louder than ever:<br>
<br>
	"Oh you simpleton! Oh you great silly!<br>
	To ask for a tub-a mere wash-tub!<br>
	What good can you get from a wash-tab?<br>
	Return to the goldfish, you silly,<br>
	Bow down low and ask for a cottage."<br>
<br>
Again he went back to the seashore, and this time the blue sea was troubled. <br>
He called out aloud for the goldfish, and the goldfish swam up and demanded:<br>
<br>
	"What is it, old man, you are wanting?"<br>
<br>
With a bow, the old man said in answer:<br>
<br>
	"Forgive me, Your Majesty Goldfish!<br>
	My old woman is angrier than ever,<br>
	Won't leave me alone for a minute-<br>
	The old scold says she wants a new cottage."<br>
<br>
The goldfish murmured in answer:<br>
<br>
	"Do not worry, go home, God be with you!<br>
	So be it! You'll have a new cottage!"<br>
<br>
So back the old man turned his footsteps; not a sign did he see of his hovel. In its place <br>
stood a new gabled cottage, with a chimney of brick, newly whitewashed, A fence with oak <br>
gates stood around it; and there sat his wife at a window; When she saw him, she scolded him roundly:<br>
<br>
"Oh you simpleton! Oh you great silly!<br>
	To ask for no more than a cottage!<br>
	Go and bow to the goldfish, and tell it<br>
	That I'm tired of being a peasant,<br>
	That I want to be made a fine lady."<br>
<br>
The old man then returned to the seashore, where the ocean was restlessly foaming, he called out <br>
aloud for the goldfish. The goldfish swam up and demanded:<br>
<br>
	"What is it, old man, you are wanting?"<br>
<br>
With a bow, the old man said in answer:<br>
<br>
	"Forgive me, Your Majesty Goldfish!<br>
	My old woman is madder than ever,<br>
	She gives me no rest for a second,<br>
	Says she's tired of being a peasant,<br>
	And wants to be made a fine lady."<br>
<br>
The goldfish murmured in answer:<br>
<br>
	"Do not worry, go home, God be with you."<br>
<br>
To his wife the old fisherman hastened, and what did he see? - a tall mansion; <br>
On its white marble stairs - his old woman. She was wearing a rich sable jacket, and s head-dress, <br>
in gold all embroidered; Her neck was with pearls heavy laden; She wore golden rings on her fingers; <br>
She was shod in the softest red leather; Zealous servants bowed meekly before her, as she cuffed them <br>
and rated them roundly. The old man then approached his wife, saying.<br>
<br>
	"Greetings, your ladyship, greetings, fine lady!<br>
	Now I hope that your soul is contented!"<br>
<br>
She angrily bade him be silent and sent him to serve in the stables.<br>
<br>
First a week slowly passed, then another, the old woman grew prouder than ever. One morning <br>
she sent for her husband, and said:<br>
<br>
	"Bow to the goldfish and tell it<br>
	I am tired of being a lady,<br>
	And I want to be made a Tsaritsa."<br>
<br>
Her husband implored her in terror, saying:<br>
<br>
	"Woman-you've surely gone crazy!<br>
	You can't even talk like a lady!<br>
	You'd be mocked at all over the kingdom!"<br>
<br>
His old woman grew madder than ever, slapped his face and then shouted in passion:<br>
<br>
	"How dare you, muzhik, stand and argue,<br>
	Stand and argue with me, a fine lady?<br>
	Go at once - if you don't, then I warn you,<br>
	You'll be dragged to the shore, willy-nilly."<br>
<br>
    The old man went down to the seashore (The ocean was swollen and sullen). <br>
	He called out aloud for the goldfish, and the goldfish swam up and demanded:<br>
<br>
	"What is it, old man, yon are wanting?"<br>
With a bow, the old man said in answer:<br>
<br>
	"Forgive me, Your Majesty Goldfish!<br>
	Again my old woman's gone crazy!<br>
	Now she's tired of being a lady!<br>
	She wants to be made a Tsaritsa."<br>
<br>
The goldfish murmured in answer:<br>
<br>
	"Do not worry, go home, God be with you!<br>
	Very well! She shall be a Tsaritsa!"<br>
<br>
To his wife the old fisherman hastened, and what did he see? A grand palace; <br>
In the palace he saw his old woman, at the table she sat, a Tsaritsa, attended by nobles and boyards; <br>
They were pouring choice wines in her goblet, she was nibbling sweet gingerbread wafers; Around her, <br>
grim guards stood in silence, with halberds upon their broad shoulders. The old man was aghast <br>
when he saw this, he bowed to her feet and said humbly:<br>
<br>
	"Greetings, Oh mighty Tsaritsa!<br>
	Now I hope that your soul is contented!"<br>
<br>
But she gave not a glance at her husband - she ordered him thrust from her presence. The boyards <br>
and nobles all hastened and drove him with blows from the chamber; The guards at the door waved <br>
their halberds and threatened to cut him to pieces. All the people derided him, saying.<br>
<br>
	"Serves you right, now, you ill-bred old fellow.<br>
	You churl-this will teach you a lesson,<br>
	To keep to your station in future!"<br>
<br>
First a week slowly passed, then another; The old woman grew prouder than ever. She sent for her <br>
husband one morning, and her chamberlain haled him before her. The old woman spoke thus to her husband:<br>
<br>
	"Go, bow to the goldfish, and tell it<br>
	That I'm tired of being Tsaritsa,<br>
	Of the seas I want to be mistress,<br>
	With my home in the blue ocean waters;<br>
	The goldfish I want for my servant<br>
	To do my commands and my errands."<br>
<br>
The old man durst not contradict her, nor open his lips to make answer. He sadly set out for the seashore. <br>
A tempest raged over the ocean, its waters were swollen and angry, its billows were boiling with fury. <br>
He called out aloud for the goldfish. The goldfish swam up and demanded:<br>
<br>
	"What is it, old man, you are wanting?"<br>
<br>
With a bow, the old man said in answer;<br>
<br>
"Forgive me, Your Majesty Goldfish!<br>
	What shall I do with my cursed old woman?<br>
	She is tired of being Tsaritsa,<br>
	Of the seas she now wants to be mistress,<br>
	With her home in the blue ocean waters;<br>
	She wants you to be her own servant,<br>
	To do her commands and her errands."<br>
    <br>
Not a word spoke the goldfish in answer, it just swished its tail, and in silence disappeared <br>
in the depths of the ocean. He waited in vain for an answer, and at last turned his steps to the palace; <br>
and behold - there again stood his hovel; On the doorstep sat his old woman, with the same broken wash-tab before her.<br>
