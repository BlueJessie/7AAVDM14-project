In country far, and days long gone,<br>
There lived a famous Tsar — Dadon.<br>
When young, his strength was held in awe<br>
By all his neighbours: he made war<br>
Whenever he declared it right.<br>
<br>
With age, he grew less keen to fight,<br>
Desiring his deserved peace: Struggle should stop; war’s clamour cease.<br>
<br>
His down-trod neighbours saw their chance,<br>
And armed with dagger, sword and lance,<br>
Attacked his frontiers at will,<br>
Making the old Tsar maintain still<br>
An army of twelve thousand men,<br>
With horses, weaponry, and then<br>
Appoint highly-paid generals<br>
To guard the kingdom’s threatened walls.<br>
<br>
But, when they watched the west, ’twas sure<br>
The eastern border, less secure<br>
Would be where hostile troops appeared,<br>
The danger greatest where least feared.<br>
Eastward the generals sally forth,<br>
Only to find that now the north<br>
Border is where the danger lies.<br>
Tormented thus, Tsar Dadon cries<br>
Hot tears of rage. He cannot sleep.<br>
O’er land foes stream; then from the deep.<br>
What is life worth, when so assailed?<br>
<br>
So, desperate, Dadon availed<br>
Himself of magic, turning to<br>
A sorcerer (and eunuch, too),<br>
Interpreter of omens, stars,<br>
Bird-flights, and such particulars.<br>
The courtier, sent to call the sage,<br>
Implied there’d be a handsome wage.<br>
Arrived at court, the wise old man<br>
Disclosed with confidence his plan:<br>
The golden cockerel he drew<br>
Out from his bag by magic knew<br>
Who would attack, and when, and where,<br>
Enabling generals to prepare.<br>
<br>
“Just watch and listen,” said the sage.<br>
Dadon responded: “I engage,<br>
If this be so, to grant as fee<br>
Whatever you request of me.<br>
So, set the cock, as weather-vane<br>
Upon the highest spire. Remain<br>
Watchful, attentive; he will show<br>
You when to arm, and where to go.<br>
Superior intelligence<br>
Will always be the best defense.”<br>
<br>
And so it proves: whenever threats<br>
Appear, the faithful sentry sets<br>
His crimson crest in that direction<br>
Whence comes th’incipient insurrection.<br>
“Kiri-ku-ku,” he cries, “Hear me,<br>
And rule long years, from worry free.”<br>
Discovered once, and caused to flee,<br>
Then thrice more routed, th’enemy<br>
Lose heart, respect again the will<br>
Of Tsar Dadon, their master still.<br>
<br>
A year so passes, then one more.<br>
Dadon expects another score.<br>
One dawn however, courtiers wake<br>
The Tsar, pale-faced, with hearts a-quake:<br>
“The cockerel, Lord, calls you to arms.<br>
Protect us, holy Tsar, from harms.”<br>
Dadon, half-sleeping, asks: “What? What?<br>
Have you your manners quite forgot?”<br>
“Forgive us, but the cock,” they say,<br>
Is adamant, brooks no delay.”<br>
The people panic. Only you<br>
Can their else-mut’nous fears subdue.<br>
<br>
Rousing himself, old Tsar Dadon<br>
Declares he’ll send his elder son<br>
Southward, whose army shall repel<br>
The foe which that true cockerel<br>
Has there disclosed. “Now back to bed<br>
“The enemy’s as good as dead.”<br>
The Tsar proclaims, “I too retire.<br>
Fear not. My spy’s still on his spire.”<br>
<br>
Wars oft entail a news black-out:<br>
Was there a victory? Or rout?<br>
Who has prevailed? How stands the score<br>
Of dead? And were ours less or more<br>
Than theirs? No word for seven days<br>
The Court’s disquietude allays.<br>
<br>
Then, on the eighth, the cockerel’s<br>
Loud cry the peace again dispels.<br>
This time his crimson comb points north.<br>
Dadon ordains to sally forth<br>
His younger son, leading a force,<br>
So rich in armour, men and horse,<br>
That no known foe could fail to yield,<br>
Such weapons Dadon’s troops now wield.<br>
<br>
They march; are gone. Silence profound<br>
Envelops them, as though the ground<br>
Had opened, as it did in truth,<br>
To swallow up all Hamlin’s youth<br>
When its authorities displayed<br>
Indiff’rence to a promise made.<br>
<br>
Ill omen! For another week<br>
The golden cock’s sharp close-clamped beak<br>
Swings slowly round, clock-wise; and then<br>
Swings just as slowly back again.<br>
But, when the eighth day dawns, the bird<br>
Crows the alarm. Grim-faced, a third<br>
Army the Tsar himself leads out.<br>
Ahead, a solitary scout,<br>
Follows the blood-red setting sun.<br>
Dadon’s last campaign has begun.<br>
Long nights and days the soldiers march:<br>
Frost cramps their feet; then hot winds parch<br>
Their throats. They seek, but find no trace<br>
Of battles, of the bloody chase<br>
Of fugitives, of funeral mounds.<br>
No rallying cries, no trumpet’s sounds<br>
Waft to the ears of Tsar Dadon,<br>
As puzzled, tired, he trudges on.<br>
<br>
Just when he’s topped a mountain pass,<br>
Descending valley-ward,… alas!<br>
What frightful vision lies before<br>
Him: scattered round a silken tent<br>
Lie those two armies Dadon sent<br>
In his defence. Now all are dead;<br>
And his two sons, unhelmeted,<br>
Hold swords plunged in each other’s breast,<br>
Hatred in four glazed eyes expressed.<br>
<br>
Oh, my dear children! Who has snared<br>
My falcons? What magician dared<br>
Villainy in their hearts to stir,<br>
To make of each a murderer?<br>
His soldiers raise such grievous groan<br>
It seems the very mountains moan. <br>
But then the curtains of the tent<br>
Are flung aside. The hands that rent<br>
Them, diamond-ringed and braceleted,<br>
The stately figure, noble head,<br>
Royalty’s redolence express..<br>
A Shamakhanskaya Princess<br>
She is, who sees Dadon, and smiles.<br>
Her beck’ning finger so beguiles<br>
Him that, bewitched, his sons forgot<br>
The Tsar accepts his destined lot:<br>
Her rule, indeed her domination.<br>
<br>
He walks, surrendering his nation,<br>
Into the silken-wall’ed tent,<br>
Wherein his next eight nights are spent<br>
In (who can doubt?) those rites of passion<br>
To detail which is out of fashion,<br>
Feasting ‘tween-times on everything<br>
Our chefs declare «fit for a king».<br>
<br>
At last begins the homeward course.<br>
The maiden, mounted on his horse,<br>
Caresses the still-love-sick Tsar.<br>
The soldiers grumble; yet they are<br>
Eager to tell their waiting friends<br>
(With what imagination lends<br>
Their memories) fantastic stuff<br>
And nonsense. Sure, they’ve seen enough!<br>
<br>
Rumours have reached the capital<br>
Before them. At its drawbridge, all<br>
The people wait in trepidation<br>
To see the ruler of the nation<br>
Approaching with his new consort,<br>
Of whom men variously report<br>
She is a witch, a whore, a queen.<br>
Never before have such things been.<br>
<br>
They greet their Tsar. His grave salute<br>
Befits his rank; but his acute<br>
Eye has detected in the crowd<br>
That eunuch-sage whose cockerel’s loud<br>
Uproar had saved the threatened state.<br>
“Approach, old man,” Dadon invites,<br>
“I grant whatever gift requites<br>
You for your golden cockerel<br>
Whose sentry-duty served so well.”<br>
<br>
“I just desire,” the wizard says,<br>
The Shamakhanskaya Princess.<br>
Come now, my lady, we must leave.”<br>
Th’astonished Tsar cannot believe<br>
His ears. “What? what? Take my princess?<br>
And you a eunuch! I confess<br>
I never heard a better joke.<br>
But seriously, when I spoke<br>
Of paying you right handsomely<br>
I also meant in reason. See,<br>
I’ll give you half my treasury;<br>
A lordship; and, if lechery<br>
Indeed attracts you, all the whores<br>
Whom you can satisfy.”<br>
<br>
With force<br>
The wizard answers: “Satisfied<br>
I’ll be only with her as bride.<br>
Give me the Shamakhan Princess.<br>
I’ll be content with nothing less.”<br>
“Take nothing then,”Tsar Dadon said.<br>
His sword-swipe smote the old man dead.<br>
The crowd was dumbstruck; but the maid,<br>
By this aggression undismayed,<br>
Burst out in laughter, peal on peal,<br>
As though by laughing to reveal<br>
Her full involvement in the plan<br>
To trick and then destroy a man.<br>
<br>
The Tsar, though startled, deigns to smile.<br>
Then on, along the Royal Mile.<br>
<br>
The crowd begins a careful cheer,<br>
Until a whir of wings they hear<br>
And see a bird with lance-like beak,<br>
A golden bird, with feathers sleek,<br>
Dive at the Tsar, piercing his head.<br>
Dadon groans once, falls, and is dead.<br>
<br>
Where’s she who was to be his queen?<br>
Vanished, as though she’d never been.<br>
<br>
The story’s false; but in it lies<br>
Some truth, seen but by inward eyes.<br>
<br>
