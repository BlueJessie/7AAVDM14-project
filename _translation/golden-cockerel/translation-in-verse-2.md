Somewhere in a secret kingdom,<br>
In a far and distant kingdom,<br>
Lived the famous Tsar Dadon.<br>
Fierce one when took the throne<br>
Put to rubbish all the neighbors<br>
Never thought about sequels;<br>
But when matured and turned gray<br>
Wished to find a peaceful way<br>
And to take repose and slumber.<br>
Then the neighbors made much trouble<br>
For the old and feeble king<br>
Giving him a lot of sting.<br>
To defend his distant borders<br>
From the permanent disorders<br>
He was urged to maintain<br>
Cohogorts of defensive men.<br>
Chiefs of guard refused to sleep,<br>
Tried to get the faithful tip:<br>
Whether from the South blast,<br>
From the East assault on us?<br>
Beat them here - savage people<br>
From the sea. Without sleeping<br>
Wept with fury Tsar Dadon,<br>
Troubles meanwhile carried on.<br>
Could one live in such a fever!<br>
Asked for help he from the clever<br>
Wise old eunuh, sorcerer,<br>
Astrologer, conjurer.<br>
Begging him to come to chamber.<br>
<br>
Came he with a tricky number -<br>
Pulled from figured tissue sack<br>
Golden Cockerel by neck.<br>
"Place - he said – this golden bird -<br>
On the top of your abode<br>
And my Golden Cockerel<br>
Will perform his duty well:<br>
While it’s quiet on the border<br>
He will sit in peace and order<br>
But at minor threat of war<br>
From each quarter of the World<br>
Or of military invasion,<br>
Or of unexpected danger,<br>
In a flash my Cockerel<br>
Will upraise his caruncle,<br>
Give a loud crow of glory<br>
And will gaze at source of worry".<br>
Tsar with grace to sorcerer<br>
Vows him a bag of pearls.<br>
"In return for this your favor, -<br>
Tsar at that time was enamoured -<br>
I would grant your premier will<br>
As my own - to fulfill".<br>
<br>
Cockerel from the top of spire<br>
Watches round for the fire.<br>
Is the danger seen by chance -<br>
Faithful sentry wakes at once<br>
Spread his wings and make a turn<br>
Towards the side it's coming from<br>
Issuing a loud cry -<br>
"Reign in peace and sidelong lie!"<br>
And the neighbor kings grew quiet,<br>
Could not further war provide:<br>
Since that year Tsar Dadon<br>
Stopped them all of fighting on.<br>
Quietly runs year after year;<br>
Cockerel keeps to watch and hear.<br>
All of a sudden Tsar Dadon<br>
Was awaked with noise and storm:<br>
"Tsar, your majesty, Godfather! -<br>
Claims the general, - the bother,<br>
Sir! Wake up! We need defense!"<br>
"What's the matter, dear friends? -<br>
Asked Dadon with loud yawn -<br>
Who is there, what is wrong?"<br>
Chief of troops replies in fever:<br>
"Cockerel shrills just more than ever;<br>
Funk and noise across the town"<br>
Tsar - to window. Makes sound,<br>
Jumps and flatters Cockerel<br>
Screaming as the warning bell<br>
"Quickly, folks, to horse, do hurry!<br>
Don't loose time, for time is money!";<br>
Tsar sends army to the East<br>
Elder son leads it abreast<br>
Cockerel's concern abated,<br>
Clamor calmed, Tsar dissipated.<br>
Eight days passed without roar<br>
No news came from the war;<br>
Whether happened any battle -<br>
Can't Dadon wise up and settle.<br>
Cockerel starts again to crow.<br>
Tsar collects the second crowd;<br>
Which the younger son will run<br>
To assist the elder one;<br>
Cockerel again keeps level.<br>
No news about travel!<br>
Came within eight lasting days;<br>
People fear, wait and pray;<br>
Cockerel starts again to crow,<br>
Tsar collects another crowd<br>
And he leads them to the East<br>
Hoping to return at least.<br>
Troops are marching day and night;<br>
All the men are deadly tired.<br>
Neither battlefield, camp ground,<br>
Nor a hill or burial mound<br>
Had encountered Tsar Dadon.<br>
"What's the miracle?" – looks he on.<br>
Week had passed of trip almighty,<br>
Tsar brought troops to highland country<br>
There, amidst sky-touching peaks<br>
Stands a silky tent on sticks.<br>
Valley lays in deep, fine silence<br>
No sound over mountains<br>
In the narrow canyon<br>
Murdered crowds sees Dadon.<br>
Near tent he sees two bodies<br>
His two sons without clothes,<br>
No armors, helmetless<br>
Swords run through each others' chests,<br>
Cold and breathless. Their horses<br>
Wander lose - free from remorses<br>
In the crushed and blood-stained grass<br>
By the narrow mountain pass<br>
Tsar gave weep: "My sons, my children!<br>
Woe is me! They both are beaten<br>
Both of proud falcons my -<br>
Nothing else I want but die!"<br>
All the army mourned and grieved<br>
Heavy echo was received<br>
From the mountains before<br>
Suddenly the silky door<br>
Of the tent was quickly opened<br>
And Shemakha Queen was gotten -<br>
Stunning beauty, like the dawn<br>
Quietly stepped to meet Dadon.<br>
Like the owl in the morning<br>
Silenced Tsar not feeling warning<br>
He forgot death of his sons<br>
At the sight of Queen at once<br>
She gave smile as rose in bloom<br>
To Dadon with little bow<br>
Took with tenderness his hand<br>
And led him inside the tent.<br>
There she sat him at the table,<br>
Feasted him with viands of fable,<br>
Bedded brocade bed for rest<br>
Tsar got in the homey nest<br>
After, for a week exactly,<br>
Captured by her charm directly,<br>
Caught in network, caught in trap,<br>
Stayed Dadon within her lap.<br>
<br>
So at length Dadon decided<br>
Back to kingdom he resided<br>
With his army and the Queen<br>
Tsar returned to home in sheen<br>
In the front of him the talking,<br>
Truth and false were widely walking.<br>
At the capital gateway<br>
Swarms of people met them gay<br>
Crowds run behind the carriage<br>
Greetings for the coming marriage<br>
Greets his people Tsar Dadon...<br>
Suddenly he stared upon<br>
Ancient, like the swan gray-headed<br>
Wearing Saracen's, unbearded<br>
Old friend, eunuch, sapient<br>
"How are you, eminent -<br>
Called the Tsar- Come over here,<br>
Tell me what you want, I hear"<br>
- Tsar! – replied the old wise sage,<br>
Let us settle at this stage.<br>
I remind you of your promise<br>
In return for my good service<br>
You would grant my premier will<br>
As your own - to fulfill.<br>
Let me now have this maiden,<br>
Queen of Shemakha, you've taken.<br>
Tsar couldn't keep from great amazement<br>
"Why requiring such payment? <br>
Either devil stole your mind?<br>
Or you're definitely blind?<br>
What accrued inside your head?<br>
If I knew you were so mad<br>
I wouldn't promise you at all.<br>
And besides, why just the girl?<br>
Easy, be aware of mine<br>
You may ask for things just fine<br>
Ask for place at royal table,<br>
Any horse from royal stable,<br>
Ask for half my kingdom yet"<br>
- "I want none of those, instead<br>
Let me take this maiden charming,<br>
Queen of Shemakha" – diviner<br>
So answered – old white hat.<br>
Spat Dadon – “Be damned for that!<br>
You will get just less than nothing.<br>
Need you, sinner, for adjusting;<br>
You'll bring trouble on your head;<br>
Drag away this ancient bat”;<br>
The old man began to argue<br>
But it's harmful with the ugly;<br>
Tsar knocked him with iron staff<br>
On the forehead - that's enough<br>
Shuddered and recoiled the crowd,<br>
Girl resumed to laugh and shout -<br>
Ha-ha-ha, then he-he-he!<br>
Say, not fears own sin.<br>
Although Tsar was frightened much,<br>
Gave to her a gentle touch.<br>
Now carriage moves to town…<br>
There arose a gentile sound<br>
And in presence of the folks<br>
Cockerel swooped from spire’s top,<br>
Flew to carriage and alighted,<br>
On Tsar’s crown like the cockfighter,<br>
Spread his wings, pecked once the Tsar<br>
And soared up in deep blue sky<br>
From the carriage Tsar Dadon<br>
Fell on earth and he was gone.<br>
And the Queen - she disappeared,<br>
As if she was never here.<br>
Tale is lie, but there's a hint!<br>
For good fellows a tip.<br>
