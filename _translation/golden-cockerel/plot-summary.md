Sometime long, long ago, in a kingdom you wouldn't know, lived Tsar Dadon the Glorious who <br>
began his reign in a notorious way by invading his neighbors, destroying their homes and their <br>
labors. Later, though, nearing old age his life entered a new phase, and the tsar wanted peace. <br>
But now his enemies unleashed barrage of their own attacks. The tsar was hardly able to relax <br>
before he needed to protect his borders from the armies and marauders.<br>
<br>
A fine war machine he did preserve and his generals would serve him well, but now he would need <br>
an astute strategy to succeed. You see, if his army guarded the south, the foe took an eastern route. <br>
Defend that flank, and the next guest would emerge from the sea. Never a rest!<br>
<br>
In private the tsar would weep, cutting into his dignity, and his sleep. In such fear, it's hardly <br>
a life, so he turned to another for advice. He summoned an old soothsayer, a eunuch, an astrologer, <br>
and sent a courier to get the man. Soon the eunuch arrived, and with great elan, lifted from a sack <br>
a cockerel of gold. To the tsar this is what he told:<br>
<br>
"On a high spire place this bird so he can be seen and heard. There my cockerel, golden from head <br>
to tail, will help protect the city without fail. If things are quiet for miles around the rooster <br>
will sit quietly, not a sound. But if unwelcome strangers do appear, if the horror of war approaches <br>
near, then the bird will size up the enemy force, and map out its expected course. Boldly the rooster <br>
will cry out, flutter its wings, stiffen its red comb, eyes fixed on the danger, away from home."<br>
<br>
The tsar, elated, bid the sage farewell, promising to fulfill any desire the man might have. The sage <br>
was quiet, call it savvy, as he would wait for events to unfold, while dreaming of fortunes untold.<br>
<br>
And so the cockerel from his high perch, for the enemy would diligently search. The minute he sensed <br>
danger, like a trustworthy farm rooster at daybreak, he would come to life. Turning in that direction, <br>
while confirming his suspicions, he'd cry, "Kiri-ku-ku! Careful, they are coming for you!"<br>
<br>
Soon the enemies day and night lost their will to fight. Their forces, regardless of number, by Dadon <br>
were ripped asunder. Two years passed in peace, and the cockerel stood at ease. Then the tsar was awakened <br>
from his sleep by loud voices and shuffling feet.<br>
<br>
"Sir! Father of our nation!" began a general's exclamation. "Sir, wake up! There's trouble!" "What is it, <br>
people?" the tsar said, breaking a yawn. "What's the matter? What's wrong?" "Sir, the bird has a threat <br>
in focus. He's giving us notice that evil winds are blowing near. People are on edge, our fate's unclear."<br>
<br>
The tsar looked at the agitated bird, and saw that it was pointed eastward. "Hurry, no time to waste! <br>
To your horses! Make haste!" The tsar sent an army to the east, his oldest son he chose to lead. The cockerel <br>
soon stood quietly, and Dadon waited patiently in the solemn city. Soon came day eight, still no news on the <br>
army's fate. If a savage battle occurred, would he have heard?<br>
<br>
Then the cockerel cried out again, and the tsar rounded up more men. He sent his other son - he had but <br>
two - to investigate and perhaps rescue his first brave unit. The cockerel quieted again and time crawled <br>
in the city for the next eight days, people worried, their thoughts strayed.<br>
<br>
Then the rooster cried out again. The tsar ordered a third set of men and led it himself to the east, <br>
uncertain if he could help in the least. Traveling day and night, his army tired quickly. Neither a fight, <br>
nor camps, nor battlefields, nor burial mounds in hills did Dadon and his troops encounter. "What's going on?" <br>
he would wonder.<br>

Now it was the eighth day ahead, and into the hills the army was led. Between two majestic hills, the verdant <br>
meadow seemed unduly still. Further down, a silk tent was seen. And in a tight ravine ... lay the tsar's <br>
first two armies, perished.<br>
<br>
To the tent Dadon rushed and witnessed a sight he feared: at the door, his two sons dear, without their <br>
helmets or armor, lay motionless, not a stir. Each had driven a lethal blade into the other. Their horses <br>
in the glade, meanwhile, roamed on trampled grass, over blood-stained sward they'd pass. The tsar wailed, <br>
"Oh, the horror! My sons! Both my warriors caught in a trap. Oh, the misery! Death come soon unto me!"<br>
<br>
Everyone grieved behind the tsar. Hills and valleys, near and far, it seemed, with pent up sorrow moaned, <br>
as well. Suddenly the tent opened ... and a stunning beauty was seen. Her name was the Shamakha Queen. Her <br>
radiance, like the new day's dawn, quietly wrapped itself around Dadon. Like a nightbird's song is stifled by sunrise, <br>
the tsar was speechless, peering into her eyes. It was here he forgot at once the tragic death of his two sons.<br>
<br>
She led the tsar inside the tent of silk. Her skin's sweet scent, her bewitching smile, her figure's allure, <br>
were heaven-sent, the tsar was sure. At the table she gave him a seat, the finest food she served to eat. <br>
On a brocade bed he rested, captured by her beauty, arrested by her charm. For a week exactly he was hers completely, <br>
seemingly trapped under the maiden's spell. And he feasted like a king, as well! Eventually, though, he needed <br>
to go back to his kingdom. So with the army intact, they returned to their more familiar haven, together with <br>
the lovely young maiden.<br>
<br>
Truths and falsehoods were rife as the city before them sprang to life. In their carriages, Dadon and the queen <br>
were followed by the masses. What a scene! Dadon greeted all, even tossed a few coins to the crowd. Then he noticed <br>
a man with a strange hat on.<br>
<br>
It was the eunuch. "Welcome, Tsar Dadon!" to his majesty the sage bellowed. "Ah, greetings my dear fellow," <br>
the tsar replied, "what do you say? Can I throw a little your way?" "Yes, sir," replied the wise man. <br>
"Indeed, it is time to settle the best we can. Remember you said you'd acquire and grant me anything I desire. <br>
Well, there is something I've seen. I want her, the Shamakha Queen!"<br>
<br>
The tsar was shocked. "Surely you jest," he mocked. "Has the devil gotten to you? How could such thoughts accrue <br>
in your head?! I gave you my word, of course, but such rubbish I've never heard. Your request needs to be <br>
within reason. And why the maiden? Is this some kind of test? From you I'd take almost any request. Take money, <br>
or the title of a noble. Take a horse from the royal stable. Take half my empire." "My dear tsar, all I desire <br>
is the maiden I've seen, the Shamakha Queen."<br>
<br>
The tsar spat in disgust. "Such evil, this is hardly fitting. Enough! You won't receive a thing, sinner, <br>
except for perhaps suffering. Be off! Take the old goat away. You're lucky you're still alive today." <br>
The old man started to argue, but such acts you don't do with the tsar, who hit him with his staff across <br>
the lips; the eunuch fell flat.<br>

He died on the spot, before a whole city shuddering. But the beauty seemed to giggle at the whole affair; <br>
for the sage's fate she didn't care. The tsar, although shaken, looked lovingly at the maiden. They began to head <br>
towards town, when from above they heard a faint sound.<br>
<br>
The whole capital looked on as the cockerel headed toward Dadon. Like a shot he flew down, landing on the tsar's crown. <br>
He fluttered wildly, pecking into his head, and flew off ... It can be said that from the carriage the tsar fell. <br>
Exactly what killed him, no one could tell. Mysteriously, the queen disappeared. It's as if she were never there.<br>
