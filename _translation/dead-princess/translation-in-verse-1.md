With his suite the Tsar departed.<br>
The Tsaritsa tender-hearted<br>
At the window sat alone,<br>
Wishing he would hurry home.<br>
All day every day she waited,<br>
Gazing till her dedicated<br>
Eyes grew weak from overstrain,<br>
Gazing at the empty plain,<br>
Not a sign of her beloved!<br>
Nothing but the snowflakes hurried<br>
Heaping drifts upon the lea.<br>
Earth was white as white could be.<br>
Nine long months she sat and waited,<br>
Kept her vigil unabated.<br>
Then from God on Christmas Eve<br>
She a daughter did receive.<br>
Next day early in the morning,<br>
Love and loyalty rewarding,<br>
Home again from travel far<br>
Came at last the father-Tsar.<br>
One fond glance at him she darted,<br>
Gasped for joy with thin lips parted,<br>
Then fell back upon her bed<br>
And by prayer-time was dead.<br>
<br>
Long the Tsar sat lonely, brooding.<br>
But he, too, was only human.<br>
Tears for one sad year he shed...<br>
And another woman wed.<br>
She (if one be strictly truthful)<br>
Was a born Tsaritsa?youthful,<br>
Slim, tall, fair to look upon,<br>
Clever, witty?and so on.<br>
But she was in equal measure<br>
Stubborn, haughty, wilful, jealous.<br>
In her dowry rich and vast<br>
Was a little looking-glass.<br>
It had this unique distinction:<br>
It could speak with perfect diction.<br>
Only with this glass would she<br>
In a pleasant humour be.<br>
Many times a day she'd greet it<br>
And coquettishly entreat it:<br>
"Tell me, pretty looking-glass,<br>
Nothing but the truth, I ask:<br>
Who in all the world is fairest<br>
And has beauty of the rarest?"<br>
And the looking-glass replied:<br>
"You, it cannot be denied.<br>
You in all the world are fairest<br>
And your beauty is the rarest."<br>
The Tsaritsa laughed with glee,<br>
Shrugged her shoulders merrily,<br>
Puffed her cheeks and bat her eyelids,<br>
Flicked her fingers coyly, slyly,<br>
Pranced around with hand on hips,<br>
Arrogance upon her lips.<br>
<br>
All this time the Tsar's own daughter<br>
Quietly, as Nature taught her,<br>
Grew and grew, and came quite soon<br>
Like a flower into bloom:<br>
Raven-browed, of fair complexion,<br>
Breathing kindness and affection.<br>
And the choice of fiance<br>
Lighted on Prince Yelisei.<br>
Suit was made. The Tsar consented<br>
And her dowry was indented:<br>
<br>
Seven towns with wealthy store,<br>
Mansion-houses ? sevenscore.<br>
On the night before the wedding<br>
For a bridal party dressing<br>
The Tsaritsa, time to pass,<br>
Chatted with her looking-glass:<br>
"Who in all the world is fairest<br>
And has beauty of the rarest?"<br>
Then what did the glass reply?<br>
"You are fair, I can't deny.<br>
But the Princess is the fairest<br>
And her beauty is the rarest."<br>
Up the proud Tsaritsa jumped.<br>
On the table how she thumped,<br>
Angrily the mirror slapping,<br>
Slipper heel in fury tapping!<br>
"O you loathsome looking-glass,<br>
Telling lies as bold as brass!<br>
By what right is she my rival?<br>
Such young folly I shall bridle.<br>
So she's grown up?me to spite!<br>
Little wonder she's so white:<br>
With her bulging mother gazing<br>
At that snow?what's so amazing!<br>
Now look here, explain to me<br>
How can she the fairer be?<br>
Scour this realm of ours and seek well,<br>
Nowhere shall you find my equal.<br>
Is not that the truth?" she cried.<br>
Still the looking-glass replied:<br>
"But the Princess is the fairest<br>
And her beauty is the rarest."<br>
The Tsaritsa burst with spite,<br>
Hurled the mirror out of sight<br>
Underneath the nearest cupboard,<br>
And when breath she had recovered<br>
Summoned Smudge, her chamber maid,<br>
And to her instructions gave:<br>
"Take the Princess to the forest,<br>
Bind her hand and foot and forehead<br>
To a tree! When wolves arrive<br>
Let them eat the girl alive!"<br>
<br>
Woman's wrath would daunt the devil!<br>
Protest was no use whatever.<br>
Soon the Princess left with Smudge<br>
For the woods. So far they trudged<br>
That the Princess guessed the reason.<br>
Scared to death by such foul treason,<br>
Loud she pleaded: "Spare my life!<br>
Innocent of guilt am I!<br>
Do not kill me, I beseech you!<br>
And when I become Tsaritsa<br>
I shall give you rich reward."<br>
Smudge, who really loved her ward,<br>
Being loth to kill or bind her,<br>
Let her go, remarking kindly:<br>
"God be with you! Do not moan!"<br>
And, this said, went back alone.<br>
"Well?" demanded the Tsaritsa,<br>
"Where's that pretty little creature?"<br>
"In the forest on her own,"<br>
Smudge replied. "And there she'll stay.<br>
To a tree I firmly lashed her.<br>
When a hungry beast attacks her<br>
She'll have little time to cry<br>
And the quicker she shall die!"<br>
<br>
Rumour spread and caused a panic:<br>
"What, the Tsar's own daughter vanished!"<br>
Mournful was the Tsar that day.<br>
But the young Prince Yelisei<br>
Offered God a fervent prayer<br>
And departed then and there<br>
To seek out and homeward guide<br>
His sweet-tempered, youthful bride.<br>
Meanwhile his young bride kept walking<br>
Through the forest until morning,<br>
Vague as to her whereabouts.<br>
Suddenly she spied a house.<br>
Out a dog ran growling, yapping,<br>
Then sat down, his tail tap-tapping.<br>
At the gate there was no guard.<br>
All was quiet in the yard.<br>
Close at heel the good dog bounded<br>
As the Princess slowly mounted<br>
Stairs to gain the living floor,<br>
Turned the ring upon the door.<br>
Silently the door swung open<br>
And before her eyes unfolded<br>
A bright chamber: all around<br>
Benches strewn with rugs she found,<br>
Board of oak beneath the ikon<br>
And a stove with tiles to lie on.<br>
To the Princess it was clear<br>
Kindly folk were dwelling here<br>
Who would not deny her shelter.<br>
No one was at home, however.<br>
So she set to, cleaned the pans,<br>
Made the whole house spick and span,<br>
Lit a candle in the corner,<br>
Fed the fire to be warmer,<br>
Climbed onto the platform bed<br>
There to lay her sleepy head.<br>
<br>
Dinner time. The yard resounded,<br>
Horses stamped and men dismounted.<br>
Thick-moustached and ruddy-skinned,<br>
Seven lusty Knights walked in.<br>
Said the Eldest: "How amazing!<br>
All so neat! The fire blazing!<br>
Somebody's been cleaning here<br>
And is waiting somewhere near.<br>
Who is there? Come out of hiding!<br>
Be a friend in peace abiding!<br>
If you're someone old and hoar,<br>
Be our uncle evermore!<br>
If you're young and love a scuffle.<br>
<br>
We'll embrace you as a brother.<br>
If a venerable dame,<br>
Then shall 'mother' be your name.<br>
If a maiden fair, we'll call you<br>
Our dear sister and adore you."<br>
So the Princess rose, came down<br>
To the Seven Knights and bowed,<br>
Her good wishes emphasising,<br>
Blushing and apologising<br>
That to their delightful home<br>
Uninvited she had come.<br>
Straight they saw her speech bore witness<br>
To the presence of a Princess.<br>
So they cleared a corner seat,<br>
Offered her a pie with meat,<br>
Filled a glass with wine and served it<br>
On a tray, as she deserved it.<br>
But the glass of heady wine<br>
She politely did decline<br>
And the pie she broke with caution,<br>
Savouring a tiny portion.<br>
Pleading she was very tired,<br>
Soon she gracefully retired<br>
And the Seven Knights conveyed her<br>
To the best and brightest chamber<br>
And, away as they did creep,<br>
She was falling fast asleep.<br>
<br>
Days flew by?the Princess living<br>
All the time without misgiving<br>
In the forest, never bored<br>
With the Seven Knights abroad.<br>
Darkness would the earth still cover<br>
When at dawn the seven brothers<br>
Would ride out to try their luck<br>
With a long-bow, shooting duck,<br>
Or to ply their sword in battle<br>
And a Saracen unsaddle,<br>
Headlong at a Tartar go,<br>
Chop his head off at a blow,<br>
Or give chase to a Circassian,<br>
From the forest send him dashing.<br>
<br>
She, as lady of the house,<br>
Rose much later, moved about<br>
Dusting, polishing and cooking,<br>
Never once the Knights rebuking.<br>
They, too, never chided her.<br>
Days flew by like gossamer.<br>
<br>
And in time they grew to love her.<br>
Thereupon all seven brothers<br>
Shortly after dawn one day<br>
To her chamber made their way<br>
And the Eldest Knight addressed her:<br>
"As you know, you are our sister.<br>
But all seven of us here<br>
Are in love with you, my dear,<br>
And we all desire your favours.<br>
But that must not be. God save us!<br>
Find some way to give us peace!<br>
Be a wife to one at least,<br>
To the rest remain a sister!<br>
But you shake your head. Is this to<br>
Say our offer you refuse?<br>
Nothing from our stock you'll choose?"<br>
"O my brave and bonny brothers,<br>
Virtuous beyond all others!"<br>
In reply the Princess'said,<br>
"God in heaven strike me dead<br>
If my answer be not honest:<br>
I've no choice?my hand is promised!<br>
You're all equal in my eyes,<br>
All so valiant and wise,<br>
And I love you all, dear brothers!<br>
But my heart is to another<br>
Pledged for evermore. One day<br>
I shall wed Prince Yelisei!"<br>
<br>
Hushed, the brothers kept their station,<br>
Scratched their foreheads in frustration.<br>
"As you wish! So now we know,"<br>
Said the Eldest with a bow.<br>
"Pray forgive us?and I promise<br>
You'll hear nothing further from us!"<br>
"I'm not angry," she replied.<br>
"By my pledge I must abide."<br>
Bowing low, the seven suitors<br>
Left her room with passions muted.<br>
So in harmony again<br>
Did they live and friendship reign.<br>
<br>
The Tsaritsa was still livid<br>
Every time she saw in vivid<br>
Memory the Princess fair.<br>
Long the mirror, lying there,<br>
Was the object of her hatred;<br>
But at last her wrath abated.<br>
So one day it came to pass<br>
That she took the looking-glass<br>
Up again and sat before it,<br>
Smiled and, as before, implored it:<br>
"Greetings, pretty looking-glass!<br>
Tell me all the truth, I ask:<br>
Who in all the world is fairest<br>
And has beauty of the rarest?"<br>
Said the mirror in reply:<br>
"You are fair, I can't deny.<br>
But where Seven Knights go riding<br>
In a green oak-grove residing<br>
Humbly lives a person who<br>
Is more beautiful than you."<br>
The Tsaritsa's wrath descended<br>
On her maid: "What folly tempted<br>
You to lie? You disobeyed!"<br>
Smudge a full confession made...<br>
Uttering a threat of torture,<br>
The Tsaritsa grimly swore to<br>
Send the Princess to her death<br>
Or not draw another breath.<br>
<br>
One day by her window waiting<br>
For her brothers homeward hasting<br>
Sat the young Princess and span.<br>
Suddenly the dog began<br>
Barking. Through the courtyard scurried<br>
A poor beggar-woman, worried<br>
By the dog she kept at bay<br>
With her stick. "Don't go away!<br>
Stay there, stay!" the Princess shouted,<br>
From the window leaning outward.<br>
"Let me call the dog to heel<br>
And I'll offer you a meal."<br>
And the beggar-woman answered:<br>
"Pretty child, you take my fancy!<br>
For that dog of yours, you see,<br>
Could well be the death of me.<br>
See him snarling, bristling yonder!<br>
Come here, child!" The Princess wanted<br>
To go out, and took a loaf.<br>
But the dog its body wove<br>
Round her feet, refused to let her<br>
Step towards the woman-beggar.<br>
When the woman, too, drew near,<br>
Wilder than an angry bear<br>
It attacked her. How perplexing!<br>
"Had a bad night's sleep, I reckon!"<br>
Said the Princess. "Catch it! There!"<br>
And the bread flew through the air.<br>
The poor beggar-woman caught it.<br>
"I most humbly thank you, daughter,<br>
God be merciful!" said she.<br>
"In return take this from me!"<br>
The bright apple she was holding,<br>
Newly picked, fresh, ripe and golden,<br>
Straight towards the Princess flew...<br>
How the dog leapt in pursuit!<br>
But the Princess neatly trapped it<br>
In her palms. "Enjoy the apple<br>
At you leisure, little pet!<br>
Thank you for the loaf of bread..."<br>
Said the beggar-woman, brandished<br>
In the air her stick and vanished...<br>
Up the stairs the Princess ran<br>
With the dog, which then began<br>
Pitifully staring, whining<br>
Just as if its heart were pining<br>
For the gift of speech to say:<br>
"Throw that apple far away!"<br>
Hastily his neck she patted:<br>
"Hey, Sokolko, what's the matter?<br>
Lie down!" Entering once more<br>
Her own room, she shut the door,<br>
Sat there with her spindle humming,<br>
Waiting for her brothers' coming.<br>
But she could not take her gaze<br>
From the apple where it lay<br>
Full of fragrance, rosy, glowing,<br>
Fresh and juicy, ripe and golden,<br>
Sweet as honey to the lips!<br>
She could even see the pips...<br>
First the Princess thought of waiting<br>
Until dinner. But temptation<br>
Proved too strong. She grasped the bright<br>
Apple, took a stealthy bite<br>
And with fair cheek sweetly hollowed<br>
A delicious morsel swallowed.<br>
All at once her breathing stopped,<br>
Listlessly her white arms dropped.<br>
From her lap the rosy apple<br>
Tumbled to the floor. The hapless<br>
Maiden closed her swooning eyes,<br>
Reeled and fell without a cry,<br>
On the bench her forehead striking,<br>
Then lay still beneath the ikon...<br>
Now the brothers, as it chanced,<br>
Were returning in a band<br>
From another warlike foray.<br>
Out to meet them in the forest<br>
Went the dog and, running hard,<br>
Led them straight into the yard.<br>
Said the Knights: "An evil omen!<br>
Grief in store!" The door they opened,<br>
Walked into the room and gasped.<br>
But the dog like lightning dashed<br>
For the apple and devoured it.<br>
Death that instant overpowered it.<br>
For the apple was, they saw,<br>
Filled with poison to the core.<br>
By the dead Princess the brothers<br>
Bent their heads in tears and uttered<br>
Holy prayer to save her soul;<br>
Nothing could their grief console.<br>
<br>
From the bench they raised her, dressed her,<br>
Wished within a grave to rest her,<br>
Then had second thoughts. For she<br>
Was as rosy as if sleep<br>
Garlands of repose were wreathing<br>
Round her?though she was not breathing.<br>
Three whole days they waited, but<br>
Still her eyes were tightly shut.<br>
So that night with solemn ritual<br>
In a coffin made of crystal<br>
They laid out the body fair<br>
Of the Princess and from there<br>
To a hollow mountain bore her,<br>
Where a tomb they fashioned for her:<br>
Iron chains they used to fix<br>
Her glass case to pillars six<br>
With due caution, and erected<br>
Iron railings to protect it.<br>
<br>
Then the Eldest smote his breast<br>
And the dead Princess addressed:<br>
"Ever peaceful be your slumber!<br>
Though your days were few in number<br>
On this earth?spite took its toll?<br>
Yet shall heaven have your soul.<br>
With pure love did we regard you,<br>
For your loved one did we guard you,<br>
But you came not to the groom,<br>
Only to a chill dark tomb."<br>
<br>
That same day the bad Tsaritsa,<br>
Waiting for good news to reach her,<br>
Secretly the mirror took<br>
And her usual question put:<br>
"Who is now by far the fairest<br>
And has beauty of the rarest?"<br>
And the answer satisfied:<br>
"You, it cannot be denied.<br>
You in all the world are fairest<br>
And your beauty is the rarest!"<br>
<br>
In pursuit of his sweet bride<br>
Through the country far and wide<br>
Still Prince Yelisei goes riding,<br>
Weeping bitterly. No tidings!<br>
For no matter whom he asks<br>
People either turn their backs<br>
Or most rudely rock with laughter:<br>
No one knows what he is after.<br>
Now to the bright Sun in zeal<br>
Did the bold young Prince appeal:<br>
"Sun, dear Sun! The whole year coursing<br>
Through the sky, in springtime thawing<br>
From the chill earth winter snow!<br>
You observe us all below.<br>
Surely you'll not grudge an answer?<br>
Tell me, did you ever chance to<br>
See the Princess I revere?<br>
I'm her fiance." "My dear,"<br>
Said the Sun with some insistence,<br>
"I have nowhere seen your Princess,<br>
So she's dead, we must presume,<br>
That is, if my friend, the Moon,<br>
Has not met her on his travels<br>
Or seen clues you may unravel."<br>
<br>
Through the dark night Yelisei,<br>
Feeling anything but gay,<br>
With a lover's perseverance<br>
Waited for the Moon's appearance.<br>
"Moon, O Moon, my friend!" he said,<br>
"Gold of horn and round of head,<br>
From the darkest shadows rising,<br>
With your eye the world apprising,<br>
You whom stars with love regard<br>
As you mount your nightly guard!<br>
Surely you'll not grudge an answer?<br>
Tell me, did you ever chance to<br>
See the Princess I revere?<br>
I'm her fiance." "O dear!"<br>
Said the Moon in consternation,<br>
"No, I have not seen the maiden.<br>
<br>
On my round I only go<br>
When it is my turn, you know.<br>
It would seem that I was resting<br>
When she passed." "How very vexing!"<br>
Cried aloud Prince Yelisei.<br>
But the Moon went on to say:<br>
"Wait a minute! I suggest you<br>
Have the Wind come to the rescue.<br>
Call him now! It's worth a try.<br>
And cheer up a bit! Goodbye!"<br>
<br>
Yelisei, not losing courage,<br>
To the Wind's abode now hurried.<br>
"Wind, O Wind! Lord of the sky,<br>
Herding flocks of clouds on high,<br>
Stirring up the dark-blue ocean,<br>
Setting all the air in motion,<br>
Unafraid of anyone<br>
Saving God in heaven alone!<br>
Surely you'll not grudge an answer?<br>
Tell me, did you ever chance to<br>
See the Princess I revere?<br>
I'm her fiance." "O hear!"<br>
Said the Wind in turmoil blowing.<br>
"Where a quiet stream is flowing<br>
Stands a mountain high and steep<br>
In it lies a cavern deep;<br>
In this cave in shadows dismal<br>
Sways a coffin, made of crystal.<br>
Hung by chains from pillars six.<br>
<br>
Round it barren land in which<br>
No man ever meets another.<br>
In that tomb your bride discover!"<br>
With a howl the Wind was gone.<br>
Yelisei wept loud and long.<br>
To the barren land he journeyed<br>
Desperately, sadly yearning<br>
Once again to see his bride.<br>
On he rode. A mountain high<br>
Rose before him, soaring steeply<br>
From a land laid waste completely.<br>
At its foot?an entrance dim.<br>
Yelisei went quickly in.<br>
There, he saw, in shadows dismal<br>
Swayed a coffin made of crystal<br>
Where the Princess lay at rest<br>
In the deep sleep of the blest.<br>
And the Prince in tears dissolving<br>
Threw himself upon the coffin...<br>
And it broke! The maiden straight<br>
Came to life, sat up, in great<br>
Wonder looked about and yawning<br>
As she set her bed see-sawing<br>
Said with pretty arms outstretched:<br>
"Gracious me! How long I've slept!"<br>
Down she stepped from out the coffin.<br>
O the sighing and the sobbing!<br>
Carrying his bride, he strode<br>
Back to daylight. Home they rode,<br>
Making pleasant conversation<br>
Till they reached their destination.<br>
Swiftly rumour spread around:<br>
"The Princess is safe and sound!"<br>
It so happened the Tsaritsa<br>
In her room was idly seated<br>
By her magic looking-glass<br>
And to pass the time did ask:<br>
"Who in all the world is fairest<br>
And has beauty of the rarest?"<br>
Said the mirror in reply:<br>
<br>
"You are fair, I can't deny,<br>
But the Princess is the fairest<br>
And her beauty is the rarest!"<br>
The Tsaritsa leapt and smashed<br>
On the floor her looking-glass,<br>
Rushing to the door she saw the<br>
Fair young Princess walk towards her.<br>
Overcome by grief and spite,<br>
The Tsaritsa died that night.<br>
From the grave where she was buried<br>
To a wedding people hurried,<br>
For the good Prince Yelisei<br>
Wed his Princess that same day.<br>
Never since the World's creation<br>
Was there such a celebration;<br>
I was there, drank mead and yet<br>
Barely got my whiskers wet.<br>
<br>
