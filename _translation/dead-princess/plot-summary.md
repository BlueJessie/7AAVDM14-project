Once upon a time there lived a tsar who had to leave his kingdom to fight a war. He left behind his pregnant wife,<br>
the queen, who sat patiently by the window waiting for his return. While he was away, she gave birth to a beautiful<br> 
baby daughter. But the pregnancy and labor had taken their toll, and the queen died the very same day that the tsar <br>
finally returned home.<br>
<br>
The tsar grieved for a year, but he eventually found a new woman to be the new queen. She was tall, good-looking,<br> 
and had a nice figure. But she was also capricious, jealous, and vain. She liked to look in her mirror, primp her hair,<br> 
and ask, "Mirror, mirror in my hand, who's the fairest throughout the land?"<br>
<br>
The mirror would reply, "My dear, you are the most fair. Your face and look are beyond compare!" The queen would then<br> 
giggle like a schoolgirl and go back to what she was doing.<br>
<br>
The tsar's daughter, meanwhile, grew up into a charming young princess. With her stunning dark eyebrows and flawless <br>
complexion, she became even prettier than the queen. It wasn't long before she became engaged with the man of her <br>
dreams - the bold and handsome Prince Elisey.<br>
<br>
Just after the news of the engagement, the queen again asked her mirror who was the fairest of them all, and the mirror <br>
answered, "You are pretty, my dear, but, I must confess, the fairest now is the princess."<br>
<br>
The jealous queen threw a fit, cursing at the mirror and throwing it down on a seat. So furious was the queen that she <br>
called in a chambermaid and ordered that the princess be taken into the heart of the woods, tied to a tree, and left <br>
there for the wolves.<br>
<br>
The chambermaid, who would never think of arguing with the queen, led the princess off deep into the dark woods and <br>
left her there. But feeling compassion for the young princess, she decided not to tie her to a tree.<br>
<br>
The princess wandered about through the night alone, feeling her way among the tall oak trees. In the morning she spotted <br>
an old country house. As she neared it, a barking dog approached the frightened princess, sniffed at her feet... and then <br>
playfully trotted around her! "Good boy!" the princess said to her new friend.<br>
<br>
Then she entered the house and found that no one was at home. Looking inside, she noticed the rich oak furniture in the <br>
dining area and the icons of saints adorning the walls. She could tell that good honest folk lived here, and started to feel <br>
more comfortable. She wandered through the rest of the house and in the afternoon curled up on a bed to rest.<br>
<br>
A short time later the owners of the house, seven hearty knights, returned for the evening. They noticed right away that <br>
something was different - their home was all tidied up, neat and clean. The princess came forward, politely bowed to them, <br>
and apologized for her disturbance. The knights, who indeed were good-hearted, took her in as if she were their sister.<br>
<br>
Days passed peacefully for everyone. When the knights went hunting, the princess would clean the house and prepare their supper. <br>
The knights found her to be so sweet and charming that once they asked that she pick one of them to be her husband. <br>
She politely refused, saying that she loved them all, but only as brothers. Besides, she said, she had already found <br>
the love of her life, Prince Elisey.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, back at the kingdom, the queen sat down at her mirror again, asking who was now fairest. The mirror replied, <br>
"You are beautiful, one can't argue. But it is also true, there still exists a beauty rarer. As before, the princess is fairer."<br>
<br>
The queen was outraged that her chambermaid had disobeyed her and that the princess wasn't dead. This time she decided <br>
to kill the princess with her own hands.<br>
<br>
A short while later the queen, disguised as an old beggar-woman, appeared at the house of the seven knights. The dog barked <br>
viciously, not letting her step on the porch. The princess, kind as she was, came out and threw a loaf of bread to the old <br>
woman who, in return, gave her a red juicy apple. The dog rushed to the princess, barking as if in warning. But the princess <br>
didn't understand and tried to soothe the dog with her gentle touch. Then she went back inside.<br>
<br>
Eventually she became very hungry, waiting for the knights to return from their hunt, and she took a small bite from <br>
the succulent-looking apple. Suddenly she teetered, fell onto a nearby bench, and took her last breath.<br>
<br>
The knights returned home and heard the dog barking wildly. They knew something was wrong, and the minute they opened <br>
the door the dog darted into the princess's room. He ate the remaining portion of the apple with one bite and died, forfeiting <br>
his life for the sake of the safety of his masters.<br>
<br>
The men were filled with grief when they saw the lifeless body of the princess. They wanted to give her a proper <br>
funeral at once, but they waited. She looked as if she were in a deep, peaceful sleep, so quiet and fresh she lay. <br>
But after three days they gave up hope and put her in a coffin made of crystal. They carried the beautiful princess in her <br>
delicate coffin to a small deserted cave.<br>
<br>
"Sleep in this coffin," the elder knight said. "So quickly you have left us. Instead we are left with just a memory, <br>
as the heavens take your spirit eternally."<br>
<br>
On that same day, the wicked queen returned to her mirror and asked who was fairest. "My dear, you are the most fair. <br>
Your face and look are beyond compare!" The queen was once again content.<br>
<br>
All this time Prince Elisey had been searching for his lost fiancee, roaming the lands far and wide on his mighty steed. <br>
He asked the sun and the moon where she was but neither knew. So Elisey asked the wind where she was <br>
and - lo and behold - the wind knew and gave him directions on how to get there! Elisey took off for the place immediately.<br>
<br>
No words could possibly describe his grief when he arrived there and saw the princess lying so very still in her crystal coffin. <br>
Elisey broke down sobbing, then he opened the coffin and kissed his fiance goodbye. But at that very moment the princess <br>
opened her eyes - she was alive again!<br>
<br>
"My, how long I've slept!" she said. Then she saw Elisay and the two embraced amid tears of joy.<br>
<br>
When they returned to the kingdom, Elisey and the princess were married and a grand feast was held, the likes of which <br>
the world had never seen before! The vain queen, meanwhile, had died in anguish when she saw that the princess was alive <br>
again and had taken back her rightful place as fairest in the land.<br>
