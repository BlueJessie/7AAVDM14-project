Long ago in a faraway kingdom, three sisters were outside in the courtyard talking, imagining <br>
what they would do if they were married to Tsar Saltan. One said that she would prepare a great feast <br>
for the entire world. The next said that she would weave linen for the entire world. The third said <br>
that she would give the tsar "an heir, handsome and brave beyond compare."<br>
<br>
It so happened that the tsar, who was just outside the fence, overheard the conversation. When he heard <br>
the words of the last maiden, he fell in love and asked her to be his wife. They were married that very <br>
same night and conceived a son soon after. The other sisters were given jobs as a cook and a weaver.<br>
<br>
A few months later the tsar went to war and had to part with his beloved wife. While he was at war his wife, <br>
the queen, gave birth to his son. A rider was sent to the tsar to convey the good news. However, the two sisters <br>
and a friend named Barbarika were so jealous of their sister's luck that they kidnapped the rider and replaced <br>
him with their own messenger who carried a note to the tsar which read: "your wife, the queen, has borne <br>
neither a son nor daughter, neither a mouse nor a frog, but had given birth to an unknown little creature."<br>
<br>
When he read this message, the tsar was mortified and sent a letter back telling his wife to wait for his <br>
return before taking any action. The scheming sisters met the rider on the way back, got him drunk, <br>
and replaced the tsar's actual letter with a fake one that ordered the queen and her baby to be put <br>
into a barrel and thrown into the sea.<br>

Of course, there was no way to disobey an order from the tsar, so the palace guards put the queen and <br>
her son into the barrel and rolled it into the water. As the queen wept inside the barrel, her son grew stronger, <br>
not by the day, but by the minute. He begged the waves to wash them onto dry land. The waves obeyed and he <br>
and his mother found themselves washed ashore on a deserted island.<br>
<br>
By now they were quite hungry, so the son made himself a bow and arrow, using small branches from a tree, <br>
and went hunting. Near the sea, he heard a screech and saw a poor swan struggling against a huge black hawk. <br>
Just as the hawk was about to bury its beak in the swan's neck, the youth shot an arrow, killing the hawk and <br>
spilling the bird's blood into the sea. The white swan swam up to the lad, thanked him and said, "you didn't <br>
kill a hawk at all, but a wicked wizard. For saving my life, I will serve you forever."<br>
<br>
The son returned to his mother and told her of his adventure, and then they both fell soundly asleep, even <br>
though they were still hungry and thirsty. The next morning they awoke and saw a wondrous city standing before <br>
them where there had been nothing before! The two marveled at the golden domes of the monasteries and churches <br>
behind the city's white walls. "My, look at all the swan has done!" the lad thought. The two walked into the <br>
city and throngs of people greeted them and crowned the young man a prince, proclaiming him Prince Gvidon.<br>
<br>
One day a merchant ship was sailing near the island when its sailors caught a glimpse of the amazing walled city. <br>
The city's cannons signaled the ship to come ashore. Prince Gvidon welcomed them and offered them food and drink. <br>
He asked what they had for sale and where they were going. "Our trade is in furs", they said, "and we are headed <br>
past the island of Buyan to the kingdom of Tsar Saltan."<br>
<br>
Gvidon asked the merchant sailors to convey his respects to the tsar, even though his mother had earlier told <br>
him about the note that led to their expulsion from the tsar's kingdom. Still, Prince Gvidon thought the best <br>
of people and could never quite believe that his father could do such a thing.<br>
<br>
As the merchant sailors were preparing to leave the island, the prince became sad when thinking about his father. <br>
"What is wrong? Why are you so gloomy," the swan said. "I so wish to see my father, the tsar", Gvidon replied. <br>
Then, with a splash of water, the swan turned the prince into a small gnat so that he could hide himself in <br>
a crack of the mast of the ship en route to see the tsar.<br>
<br>
When the ship arrived at the Tsar Saltan's kingdom, the tsar greeted the merchant sailors and asked them <br>
to tell of the lands they had seen. The sailors told the tsar about the island and the walled city, and spoke <br>
of the hospitable Prince Gvidon. The tsar did not know that this Prince Gvidon was his son, but expressed a wish <br>
to see this beautiful city anyway. The two sisters and the old Barbarika did not want to let him go, however, <br>
and acted as if there were nothing to marvel at in the sailors' tale. "What is really amazing," they said, <br>
"is a squirrel that sits under a fir tree, cracking golden nuts containing kernels of pure emerald, and singing<br>
 a song. That's something which is truly extraordinary!"<br>
<br>
Hearing this, the gnat, really Prince Gvidon, got angry and stung the old woman's right eye. After he flew back <br>
to the island, Gvidon told the swan the story he heard about the remarkable squirrel. Then the prince walked into <br>
his courtyard and, lo and behold, there was the singing squirrel, sitting under a fir tree, cracking golden nuts! <br>
The prince rejoiced at this and ordered that a crystal house be built for the little animal. He placed a guard <br>
there to stand watch and ordered a scribe to record every shell. Profit for the prince, honor for the squirrel!<br>
<br>
Some time later, a second ship came to the island enroute to the tsar and the prince again told the swan that <br>
he wished to see his father again. This time, the swan turned the prince into a fly so that he could hide in a <br>
crack of the ship.<br>
<br>
After the vessel arrived in the kingdom, the sailors told Tsar Saltan about the wondrous squirrel they had seen. <br>
Saltan again wanted to visit this fabled city but was talked out of it when the two sisters and Barbarika ridiculed <br>
the sailors' story and spoke themselves of a greater wonder--of thirty-three handsome young knights, led by old <br>
Chernomor, rising from out of the raging sea. The fly, Gvidon, became quite angry with the women and stung Barbarika's<br>
 left eye before flying back to the island.<br>
<br>
Once home again, he told the swan about old Chernomor and the thirty-three knights, and lamented that he had never <br>
seen such a wonder. "These knights are from the great waters that I know," the swan said. "Don't be sad, for these <br>
knights are my brothers and they will come to you."<br>
<br>
Later, the prince went back and climbed a tower of his palace and gazed at the sea. Suddenly, a giant wave rose high <br>
and deep onto the shore, and when it receded, thirty-three knights in armor, led by old Chernomor, emerged, ready to <br>
serve Prince Gvidon. They promised that they would come out of the sea each day to protect the city.<br>
<br>
A few months later, a third ship came to the island. In his customary fashion, the prince again made the sailors <br>
feel welcome and told them to send his respects to the tsar. As the sailors prepared themselves for their journey, <br>
the prince told the swan that he still couldn't get his father out of his mind and wished to see him again. This time<br>
 the swan turned the prince into a bumblebee.<br>
<br>
The ship arrived in the kingdom and the sailors told Tsar Saltan about the wondrous city they had seen and how <br>
every day thirty-three knights and old Chernomor would emerge from the sea to protect the island.<br>
<br>
The tsar marveled at this and wanted to see this extraordinary land, but once again was talked out of it by the two <br>
sisters and old Barbarika. They belittled the sailors' tale and said that what was really amazing was that beyond <br>
the seas lived a princess so stunning that you couldn't take your eyes off of her. "The light of day pales against <br>
her beauty, the darkness of night is lit up by it. When she speaks it is like the murmur of a tranquil brook. Now <br>
that's a marvel!" they said. Gvidon, the bumblebee, got angry at the women once more and stung Barbarika on her nose. <br>
They tried to catch him, but to no avail. He was safely on his journey back home.<br>
<br>
After his arrival there, Gvidon strolled out to the seashore until he was met by the white swan. "Why so gloomy this<br>
 time?" the swan asked. Gvidon said that he was sad because he did not have a wife. He related the tale he had heard <br>
 of the beautiful princess whose beauty lit up the darkness, whose words flowed like a murmuring brook. The swan was <br>
 silent for awhile, then said that there was such a princess. "But a wife," the swan continued, "is no glove that <br>
 one can simply cast from one's hand." Gvidon said he understood but that he was prepared to walk the rest of his <br>
 life and to all corners of the world to search for the wondrous princess. At this, the swan sighed and said:<br>
<br>
	There's no need to travel,<br>
	There's no need to tire.<br>
	The woman that you desire,<br>
	Is now yours to spy.<br>
	The princess is I.<br>
    <br>
With this, she flapped her wings and turned into the beautiful woman that the prince had heard about. The two <br>
passionately embraced and kissed, and Gvidon took her to meet his mother. The prince and the beautiful maiden were <br>
married that very same evening.<br>
<br>
A short time later, another ship came to the island. As usual, Prince Gvidon welcomed the sailors and, as they <br>
were leaving, he asked the sailors to send his greetings to the tsar and to extend an invitation to him to visit. <br>
Being happy with his new bride, Gvidon decided not to leave the island this time.<br>
<br>
When the ship arrived at the kingdom of Tsar Sultan, the sailors again told the tsar of the fantastic island they <br>
had seen, of the singing squirrel cracking the golden nuts, of the thirty-three armored knights rising out of the sea, <br>
and of the lovely princess whose beauty was beyond compare.<br>
<br>
This time the tsar would not listen to the snide remarks of the sisters and Barbarika. He called his fleet and set<br>
 sail for the island immediately.<br>
<br>
When he reached the island, Prince Gvidon was there to meet the tsar. Saying nothing, Gvidon led him, along with <br>
his two sisters-in-law and Barbarika, to the palace. Along the way, the tsar saw everything that he had heard <br>
so much about. There at the gates were the thirty-three knights and old Chernomor standing guard. There in <br>
the courtyard was the remarkable squirrel, singing a song and gnawing on a golden nut. There in the garden was <br>
the beautiful princess, Gvidon's wife. And then the tsar saw something unexpected: there standing next to the <br>
princess was Gvidon's mother, the tsar's long-lost wife. The tsar recognized her immediately. With tears streaming <br>
down his cheeks, he rushed to embrace her, and years of heartache were now forgotten. He then realized that Prince <br>
Gvidon was his son, and the two threw their arms around each other as well.<br>
<br>
A merry feast was held. The two sisters and Barbarika hid in shame, but eventually they were found. They burst <br>
into tears, confessing everything. But the tsar was so happy that he let them all go. The tsar and the queen and <br>
Prince Gvidon and the princess lived the rest of their days in happiness.<br>
