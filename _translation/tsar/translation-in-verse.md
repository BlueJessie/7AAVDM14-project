Three fair maidens, late one night,<br>
Sat and spun by candlelight.<br>
"Were our tsar to marry me,"<br>
Said the eldest of the three,<br>
"I would cook and I would bake–<br>
Oh, what royal feasts I'd make."<br>
Said the second of the three:<br>
"Were our tsar to marry me,<br>
I would weave a cloth of gold<br>
Fair and wondrous to behold."<br>
But the youngest of the three<br>
Murmured: "If he married me–<br>
I would give our tsar an heir<br>
Handsome, brave, beyond compare."<br>
<br>
At these words their chamber door<br>
Gently creaked– and lo, before<br>
These three maidens' very eyes<br>
Stood their tsar, to their surprise.<br>
He had listened by their gate<br>
Whither he'd been led by fate,<br>
And the words that he heard last<br>
Made his heart with love beat fast.<br>
"Greetings, maiden fair," said he–<br>
"My tsaritsa you shall be,<br>
And, ere next September's done,<br>
See that you bear me a son.<br>
As for you, fair sisters two,<br>
Leave your home without ado;<br>
Leave your home and follow me<br>
And my bride that is to be.<br>
Royal weaver, YOU I'll make,<br>
YOU as royal cook I'll take."<br>
<br>
Then the tsar strode forth, and they<br>
Palacewards all made their way.<br>
There, he lost no time nor tarried<br>
That same evening he was married;<br>
Tsar Saltan and his young bride<br>
At the feast sat side by side.<br>
Then the guests, with solemn air,<br>
Led the newly wedded pair<br>
To their iv'ry couch, snow-white,<br>
Where they left them for the night.<br>
Bitterly, the weaver sighed,<br>
And the cook in passion cried,<br>
Full of jealousy and hate<br>
Of their sister's happy fate.<br>
But, by love and duty fired,<br>
She conceived, ere night expired,<br>
In her royal husband's arms.<br>
<br>
These were days of war's alarms.<br>
Ere he rode forth for the strife,<br>
Tsar Saltan embraced his wife,<br>
Bidding her to take good care<br>
Of herself and coming heir;<br>
While he battled on the field,<br>
Forcing countless foes to yield,<br>
God gave unto her an heir–<br>
Lusty, large of limb, and fair.<br>
Like a mother eagle, she<br>
Guarded him most jealously;<br>
Sent the news of God's glad gift<br>
To the tsar, by rider swift.<br>
But the royal cook, and weaver,<br>
And their mother, sly deceiver,<br>
Sought to ruin her, so they<br>
Had him kidnapped on the way,<br>
Sent another in his stead.<br>
Word for word, his message read:<br>
"Your tsaritsa, sire, last night<br>
Was delivered of a fright–<br>
Neither son nor daughter, nor<br>
Have we seen its like before."<br>
<br>
At these words, the royal sire<br>
Raved and raged in furious ire,<br>
"Hang that messenger!" roared he,<br>
"Hang him on the nearest tree!"<br>
But, relenting, spared him, and<br>
Sent him back with this command:<br>
"From all hasty steps refrain<br>
Till the tsar comes home again."<br>
<br>
Back the messenger rode fast,<br>
Reached the city gates at last.<br>
But the royal cook, and weaver,<br>
With their mother, sly deceiver,<br>
Made him drunk; and in his sleep<br>
Stole the message from his keep<br>
And, before he could recover,<br>
They replaced it by another.<br>
So, with feet unsteady, he<br>
Reached the court with this decree:<br>
"Have the queen and have her spawn<br>
Drowned in secret ere the dawn."<br>
Grieving for their monarch's heir,<br>
For the mother young and fair,<br>
Solemnly the tsar's boyards<br>
Told the queen of this ukaz,<br>
Of the cruel doom which fate<br>
So unkindly had in wait.<br>
This unpleasant duty done,<br>
Put the queen and put her son<br>
In a cask, and sealed it fast;<br>
Tarred it well, and then they cast<br>
Cask and burden in the sea–<br>
Such, forsooth, the tsar's decree.<br>
<br>
Stars gleam in the dark blue sky,<br>
Dark blue billows heave and sigh.<br>
Storm clouds o'er the blue sky creep,<br>
While the cask rides o'erthe deep.<br>
Like a widowed bride distressed,<br>
Sobbed the queen and beat her breast,<br>
While the babe to manhood grew<br>
As the hours swiftly flew.<br>
Morning dawned, the queen still waited<br>
But her son the billows hailed:<br>
"O, you wanton waves so blue –<br>
Free to come and go are you,<br>
Dashing when and where you please,<br>
Wearing rocks away with ease –<br>
You, who flood the mountains high,<br>
You, who ships raise to the sky–<br>
Hear my prayer, o waves, and spare us–<br>
Safely onto dry land bear us."<br>
So the waves, without ado,<br>
Bore the cask and prisoners two<br>
Gently to a sandy shore,<br>
Then, receding, splashed no more.<br>
Son and mother, safe and sound,<br>
Feel that they're on solid ground.<br>
From their cask, though, who will take them?<br>
Surely God will not forsake them?<br>
Murmuring: "I wonder how<br>
We could break our prison now?"<br>
Up the son stood on his toes,<br>
Stretched himself, and said: "Here goes!"–<br>
Thrust his head against the lid,<br>
Burst it out–and forth he slid.<br>
<br>
Son and mother, free again,<br>
Saw a hillock on a plain;<br>
On its crest, an oak tree grew;<br>
Round them flowed the ocean blue.<br>
Quoth the son: "Some food and drink<br>
Wouldn't come amiss, I think."<br>
From the oak, a branch he rent<br>
And a sturdy bow he bent.<br>
With the silken cord that hung<br>
Round his neck, the bow he strung.<br>
From a slender reed and light,<br>
Shaped an arrow, true in flight.<br>
Then explored the isle for game,<br>
Till he to the sea-shore came.<br>
<br>
Just as he approached the beach,<br>
Our young hunter heard a screech..;<br>
Of distress at sea it told.<br>
He looked round him, and, behold,<br>
Saw a swan in evil plight;<br>
Circling over it–a kite,<br>
Talons spread, and bloodstained beak<br>
Poised, prepared her death to wreak,<br>
While the helpless bird was splashing,<br>
With her wings the waters lashing.<br>
But his shaft, with baneful note,<br>
Struck the kite full in the throat.<br>
Bleeding, in the sea it fell,<br>
Screeching like a soul in hell.<br>
He, with lowered bow, looked on<br>
As, with beak and wings, the swan,<br>
Dealing ruthless blow on blow<br>
On the cruel kite, her foe,<br>
Sped its death, till finally<br>
Lifeless it sank in the sea.<br>
Then, in Russian accents, she<br>
Murmured plain as plain could be:<br>
"O, tsarevich, champion peerless,<br>
My deliverer so fearless–<br>
Grieve not that because of me<br>
Your good shaft is in the sea:<br>
That you'll have to fast three morrows–<br>
This is but the least of sorrows.<br>
Your kind deed I will repay–<br>
I will serve you too, one day;<br>
'Tis no swan that you set free,<br>
But a maiden charmed, you see;<br>
'Twas a wizard, not a kite,<br>
That you slew, O noble knight;<br>
I shall ne'er forget your deed–<br>
I'll be with you in your need.<br>
Now go back and take your rest–<br>
All will turn out for the best."<br>
<br>
Then the swan-bird flew from view<br>
While, perforce, the luckless two,<br>
Famished, laid them down to sleep,<br>
Praying God their souls to keep.<br>
Driving slumber from his eyes<br>
As the sun rose in the skies,<br>
Our tsarevich, much amazed,<br>
At a spacious city gazed,<br>
Girdled by a wide and tall,<br>
Strong-embattled snow-white wall.<br>
Churches golden-domed stood there,<br>
Holy cloisters, mansions fair.<br>
"Mother mine, awaken!" cried he–<br>
"Oh!" she gasped; he said: "I see<br>
Things have only just begun–<br>
My white swan is having tun,"<br>
Citywards their steps they bent,<br>
Through the city gates they went.<br>
Belfries thundered overhead<br>
Loud enough to wake the dead.<br>
Round them poured a mighty throng,<br>
Choir boys praised the Lord in song;<br>
Nobles, splendidly arrayed,<br>
Came in coaches, gold inlaid.<br>
All the people cheered them madly,<br>
As their prince acclaimed him gladly,<br>
With his mother's blessing, he,<br>
Acquiescing graciously,<br>
That same day began to reign<br>
In his newly-found domain,<br>
Sat in state upon the throne<br>
And was crowned as Prince Guidon.<br>
<br>
Breezes o'er the ocean play,<br>
Speed a barque upon its way;<br>
Sails all spread, it skims the seas,<br>
Running swiftly 'fore the breeze.<br>
Sailors, merchants, crowd the deck,<br>
Marvel loud and crane their necks.<br>
Wondrous changes meet their view<br>
On an island which they knew!<br>
There, a golden city grand,<br>
Newly built, and fortress stand,<br>
Cannons with a mighty roar<br>
Bid the merchants put to shore.<br>
When the merchants land, Guidonv<br>
Bids them be his guests anon;<br>
Feasts them first with meats and wit<br>
Then he says: "Now, masters mine–<br>
Tell me what you have for sale,<br>
Whither bound, and whence you hail?"<br>
Said the merchants: "If you please.<br>
We have sailed the seven seas;<br>
Costly furs, prince, were our ware.<br><br>
Silver fox and sables rare.<br>
Now our time is overstayed,<br>
East–due East–our course is laid,<br>
Past the Island of Buyan,<br>
Back to gracious Tsar Saltan."<br>
"Gentles," murmured Prince Guidon,<br>
"May fair breezes speed you on,<br>
And, when Tsar Saltan you see<br>
Bow down low to him for me."<br>
Here the merchants made their bows,<br>
And the prince, with pensive brows,<br>
Watched their ship put out from shore<br>
Till it could be seen no more.<br>
Suddenly, before Guidon<br>
Swam the graceful snow-white swan.<br>
"Greetings, my fair prince," said she–<br>
"Why are you so sad, tell me?<br>
Why are you so dismal, say,<br>
Like a gloomy, cloudy day?"<br>
"Grief is gnawing at my breast,"<br>
Answered Prince Guidon, distressed.<br>
"I have only one desire–<br>
I should like to see my sire."<br>
"Is that all?" was her reply–<br>
"Listen–would you like to fly,<br>
Overtake that ship at sea?<br>
Why, then–a mosquito be!"<br>
Then she flapped her pinions two,<br>
Loudly thrashed the waters blue,<br>
Drenching him from head to toe<br>
Ere he could say yes or no.<br>
And he hovered, then and there,<br>
A mosquito, in the air.<br>
Buzzed, and flying rapidly,<br>
Overtook the ship at sea,<br>
Settled noiselessly, and stole<br>
Out of sight, into a hole.<br>
<br>
Merrily the breeze is singing,<br>
O'er the waves a ship is winging<br>
Past the Island of Buyan<br>
To the realm of Tsar Saltan.<br>
Now his longed-for land so dear<br>
Stands out in the distance, clear,<br>
Now the ship at anchor rests<br>
And the merchants, honored guests,<br>
Palacewards their footsteps make<br>
With our gallant in their wake.<br>
There, in regal raiment, sate<br>
Tsar Saltan in royal state.<br>
On his head–his jeweled crown;<br>
On his face–a pensive frown,<br>
While the royal cook, and weaver,<br>
And their mother, sly deceiver,<br>
Sitting on his left and right,<br>
Stared at him with all their might.<br>
Tsar Saltan, with royal grace,<br>
Gave the merchants each his place,<br>
Then he said: "Now, masters mine,<br>
Sailed you far across the brine?<br>
Are things well where you have been?<br>
What strange wonders have you seen?"<br>
Quoth the merchants: "If you please,<br>
We have sailed the seven seas;<br>
Peace reigns overseas, serene.<br>
There, we saw this wondrous scene:<br>
There's an island in the sea,<br>
Shores as steep as steep can be;<br>
Cheerless once, deserted, bare–<br>
Nothing but an oak grew there.<br>
Now it has a new-built city,<br>
Stately mansions, gardens pretty,<br>
Churches tall with domes of go<br>
Fair and wondrous to behold.<br>
Prince Guidon reigns there, and<br>
Sends his compliments to thee.'<br>
Here the tsar said, in amaze:<br>
"If but God prolong my days,<br>
I shall visit this strange isle,<br>
Guest with this Guidon a while."<br>
But the royal cook, and weaver,<br>
With their mother, sly deceiver,<br>
Did not wish to let their tsar<br>
See this wondrous isle so far.<br>
"What a wonder," quoth the cook,<br>
Winking at the others"Look:<br>
There's a city by the shore!<br>
Have you heard the like before?<br>
Here's a wonder, though, worth telling–<br>
There's a little squirrel dwelling<br>
In a fir tree; all day long,<br>
Cracking nuts, it sings a song.<br>
Nuts–most wondrous to behold!<br>
Every shell is solid gold;<br>
Kernels–each an emerald pure!<br>
That's a wonder, to be sure."<br>
Tsar Saltan thought this most curious,<br>
Our mosquito waxed most furious<br>
And, with his mosquito might,<br>
Stung his aunt's right eye, in spite.<br>
Turning pale, she swooned from pain–<br>
But her eye ne'er saw again.<br>
Sister, serving maids and mother,<br>
Chased him, tripping one another,<br>
Screamed: "You cursed insect, you!<br>
Only wait!" But he just flew<br>
Through a casement, o'erthe main,<br>
Swiftly to his own domain.<br>
<br>
Pensively Guidon once more<br>
Gazes seaward from the shore.<br>
Suddenly, before his sight<br>
Swam the graceful swan, snow-white.<br>
"Greetings, my fair prince," said she–<br>
"Why are you so sad, tell me?<br>
Why are you so dismal, say<br>
Like a gloomy, cloudy day?"<br>
"Grief is gnawing at my breast,"<br>
Answered Prince Guidon, distressed–<br>
"There's a wonder, I confess,<br>
That I'm burning to possess.<br>
'Tis a wonder well worth telling–<br>
Somewhere, there's a squirrel dwelling<br>
In a fir tree; all day long,<br>
Cracking nuts, it sings a song.<br>
Nuts, most wondrous, I am told;<br>
Every shell is solid gold,<br>
Kernels–each an emerald pure.<br>
But can I of this be sure?"<br>
Here the swan said in reply:<br>
"Yes–this rumor does not lie;<br>
Marvel not–though this may be<br>
Strange for you, 'tis not for me.<br>
Grieve not–I will gladly do
This slight service, prince, for you."<br>
Home he sped with cheerful stride,<br>
Gained his palace courtyard wide.<br>
There, beneath a fir–behold!–<br>
Cracking nuts all made of gold,<br>
Emeralds left and right a-flinging,<br>
Sat that wonder-squirrel, singing:<br>
"Through the garden there she goes,<br>
Tripping on her dainty toes."<br>
With its tail the squirrel sweeps<br>
Shells and stones in tidy heaps,<br>
While a charmed and happy throng<br>
Listened to the squirrel's song.<br>
Struck with wonder, Prince Guidon<br>
Whispered softly: "Thank you, swan!<br>
God grant you felicity<br>
And such joy as you gave me."<br>
Then a squirrel's house he built.<br>
Crystal, glass, and silver gilt;<br>
Set a guard, a scribe as well,<br>
Who recorded every shell.<br>
Thus the prince's treasures grew,<br>
And the squirrel's glory too.<br>
<br>
Breezes o'er the ocean play<br>
Speed a barque upon its way;<br>
Sails all spread, it skims the seas,<br>
Running swiftly "fore the breeze<br>
Past a craggy island, where<br>
Stands a city, proud and fair.<br>
Cannons with a mighty roar<br>
Bid the merchants put to shore;<br>
When the merchants land, Guidon<br>
Bids them be his guests anon;<br>
Feasts them first with meats and wine,<br>
Then he says: "Now, masters mine–<br>
Tell me what you have for sale,<br>
Whither bound, and whence you hail?"<br>
Said the merchants: "If you please,<br>
We have sailed the seven seas,<br>
Selling horses, Prince Guidon–<br>
Stallions from the steppes of Don.<br>
We are overdue, you know,<br>
And we still have far to go–<br>
Past the Island of Buyan,<br>
Back to gracious Tsar Saltan."<br>
"Gentles," murmured Prince Guidon–<br>
"May fair breezes speed you on<br>
O'er the ocean, o'er the main,<br>
Back to Tsar Saltan again,<br>
When your gracious tsar you see,<br>
Give him compliments from me."<br>
<br>
Bowing low before him, they<br>
Left Guidon and sailed away.<br>
He, though, hastened to the shore,<br>
Where he met the swan once more,<br>
Told her that his heart was burning,<br>
For his sire, his soul was yearning...<br>
In the twinkling of an eye<br>
He became a tiny fly,<br>
And he flew across the sea<br>
Where, 'twixt sky and ocean, he<br>
Settled on the deck and stole<br>
Out of sight into a hole.<br>
<br>
Merrily the breeze is singing,<br>
O'er the waves a ship is winging,<br>
Past the Island of Buyan,<br>
To the realm of Tsar Saltan,<br>
Now his longed-for land so dear,<br>
Stands out in the distance, clear,<br>
Now the ship at anchor rests,<br>
And the merchants, honored guests,<br>
Palacewards their footsteps make<br>
With our gallant in their wake.<br>
There, in regal raiment, sate<br>
Tsar Saltan in royal state.<br>
On his head–his jeweled crown,<br>
On his face–a' pensive frown,<br>
While the one-eyed cook, and weaver,<br>
And their mother, sly deceiver,<br>
Sit around the tsar and stare<br>
At him with a toad-like glare.<br>
Tsar Saltan, with royal grace,<br>
Gave the merchants each his place,<br>
Then he said: "Now, masters mine–<br>
Sailed you far across the brine?<br>
Are things well where you have been?<br>
What strange wonders have you seen?"<br>
Quoth the merchants: "If you please,<br>
We have sailed the seven seas;<br>
Peace reigns overseas, serene.<br>
There, we saw this wondrous scene:<br>
On an island, far away,<br>
Stands a city, grand and gay–<br>
Churches tall, with golden domes,<br><br>
Gardens green and stately homes;<br>
By the palace grows a fir<br>
In whose shade, O royal sir,<br>
Stands a crystal cage; and there<br>
Dwells a squirrel, strange and rare–<br>
Full of frolic; all day long,<br>
Cracking nuts, it sings a song,<br>
Nuts, most wondrous to behold–<br>
Every shell is solid gold,<br>
Kernels–each an emerald bright;<br>
Sentries guard it day and night,<br>
It has slaves, like any lord,<br>
Yes, and scribes each nut record.<br>
Troops in passing give salute<br>
With their martial drum and flute.<br>
Maidens store these gems away<br>
Under lock and key each day;<br>
Coins are minted from each shell,<br>
Coins with which they buy and sell.<br>
People live in plenty there,<br>
Not in huts, but mansions fair.<br>
Prince Guidon reigns there, and he<br>
Sends his compliments to thee."<br>
Here the tsar said, in amaze:<br>
"If but God prolong my days,<br>
I shall visit this strange isle<br>
Guest with this Guidon a while."<br>
But the cook, and royal weaver,<br>
With their mother, sly deceiver,<br>
Did not wish to let the tsar<br>
See this wondrous isle so far.<br>
And the weaver, smiling wryly,<br>
Thus addressed the tsar, most slyly:<br>
"Wherein lies this wonder, pray?<br>
Squirrels cracking nuts all day–<br>
Heaping emeralds, we're told,<br>
Left and right a-throwing gold!<br>
Nothing strange in this see I!
Be this true, or but a lie,<br>
I know of a better wonder.<br>
Lo! The ocean swells in thunder,<br>
Surges with a mighty roar,<br>
Overflows a barren shore,<br>
Leaving, wonderful to see,<br>
Thirty stalwart knights and three,<br>
All in mail a-gleaming bright,<br>
Marching proudly left and right;<br>
Each one brave beyond compare,<br>
Tall of stature, young and fair,<br>
All alike beyond belief,<br>
Led by Chernomor, their chief.<br>
That's a wonder, now, for you,<br>
Marvelously strange, but true."<br>
Wisely, though, the guests were mute–<br>
They with her did not dispute.<br>
But the tsar waxed very curious,<br>
And Guidon waxed very furious,<br>
Fiercely buzzed and settled right
On his aunt's left eye, in spite.<br>
Turning pale, she gave a cry–<br>
She was blinded in her eye.<br>
Screams of anger filled the air–<br>
"Catch it! kill that insect there!<br>
O you nasty insect, you!"<br>
But Guidon just calmly flew<br>
Through the casement, o'erthe main,<br>
Swiftly to his own domain.<br>
<br>
By the blue sea he is pacing,<br>
On the blue sea he is gazing.<br>
And once more, before his sight<br>
Swam the graceful swan, snow-white.<br>
"Greetings, my fair prince," said she,<br>
"Why are you so sad, tell me?<br>
Why are you so dismal, say,<br>
Like a gloomy, cloudy day?"<br>
"Grief is gnawing at my breast,"<br>
Answered Prince Guidon, distressed–<br>
"There's a wonder, I confess,<br>
That I'm longing to possess,"<br>
"Tell me then, what is this wonder?"<br>
"Somewhere swells the sea in thunder,<br>
Breakers surge, and with a roar,<br>
Sweeping o'er a barren shore,<br>
Leave behind, for all to see<br>
Thirty stalwart knights and three,<br>
All in mail a-gleaming bright,<br>
Marching proudly left and right;<br>
Each one brave beyond compare,<br>
Tall of stature, young and fair.
All alike beyond belief,<br>
Led by Chernomor, their chief."<br>
In reply, the snow-white swan<br>
Murmured: "Is this all, Guidon?<br>
Wonder not– though this may be<br>
Strange for you, 'tis not for me,<br>
or these sea-knights, prince, are none<br>
But my brothers, every one.
Do not grieve; go home and wait,<br>
Meet my brothers at your gate."<br>
<br>
He obeyed her cheerfully,<br>
Climbed his tower and scanned the seas<br>
Lo! the waters, with a roar.<br>
Seethed and swept the barren shore,<br>
Leaving, wonderful to see,<br>
Thirty stalwart knights and three,<br>
All in mail a-gleaming bright,<br>
Marching proudly left and right,<br>
Two by two; and Chernomor,<br>
Hoary-headed, went before,<br>
Leading them in martial state<br>
Right up to the city gate,<br>
Prince Guidon, with flying feet,<br>
Ran in haste his guests to greet;<br>
Crowds pressed round in unbelief.<br>
"Prince," proclaimed the hoary chief–<br>
"It is by the swan's request<br>
And, at her express behest,<br>
We have come from out the sea<br>
Your fair city's guards to be.<br>
Henceforth, from the ocean blue,<br>
We will always come to you<br>
Every day, on guard to stand<br>
By your lofty walls so grand.<br>
Now, however, we must go–<br>
We're not used to land, you know:<br>
We'll return, I promise you."<br>
And they disappeared from view.<br>
Breezes o'erthe ocean play<br>
Speed a barque upon its way;<br>
Sails all spread, it skims the seas,<br>
Running swiftly 'fore the breeze,<br>
Past a craggy island, where<br>
Stands a city, proud and fair.<br>
Cannons with a mighty roar<br>
Bid the merchants put to shore;<br>
When the merchants land, Guidon<br>
Bids them be his guests anon;<br>
Feasts them first with meat and wine,<br>
Then he says: "Now, masters mine–<br>
Tell me what you have for sale,<br>
Whither bound, and whence you hail?"<br>
Said the merchants: "If you please,<br>
We have sailed the seven seas;<br>
Swords of Damask steel we've sold,<br>
Virgin silver, too, and gold.<br>
Now we're overdue, you know,<br>
And we still have far to go–<br>
Past the Island of Buyan,<br>
Back to gracious Tsar Saltan,"<br>
"Gentles," murmured Prince Guidon–<br>
"May fair breezes speed you on,<br>
O'er the ocean, o'er the main,<br>
Back to Tsar Saltan again.<br>
Yes, and when your tsar you see,<br>
Give him compliments from me."<br>
<br>
Bowing low before him, they<br>
Left the prince and sailed away.<br>
He, though, hastened to the shore<br>
Where he met the swan once more;<br>
Told her that his heart was burning,<br>
For his sire, his soul was yearning...<br>
So she drenched him, head to toe.<br>
In a trice, he shrank, and lo!<br>
Ere or he could even gasp,<br>
He had turned into a wasp.<br>
Then he buzzed, and rapidly<br>
Overtook the ship at sea;<br>
Gently settled aft, and stole<br>
Out of sight into a hole.<br>
<br>
Merrily the breeze is singing,<br>
O'erthe waves a ship is winging<br>
Past the Island of Buyan<br>
To the realm of Tsar Saltan.<br>
Now his longed-for land so dear<br>
Stands out in the distance, clear.<br>
Now the ship at anchor rests,<br>
And the merchants, honored guests<br>
Palacewards their footsteps make<br>
With our gallant in their wake.<br>
There, in regal raiment, sate<br>
Tsar Saltan in royal state.<br>
On his head–his jeweled crown,<br>
On his face–a pensive frown,<br>
Near him–royal cook, and weaver<br>
And their mother, sly deceiver.<br>
With four eyes, though they be three,<br>
Stare at him voraciously.<br>
Tsar Saltan, with royal grace,<br>
Gave the merchants each his place.<br>
Then he said: "Now, masters mine–<br>
Sailed you far across the brine?<br>
Are things well where you have been?<br>
What strange wonders have you seen?"<br>
Quoth the merchants: "If you please,<br>
We have sailed the seven seas;<br>
Peace reigns overseas, serene,<br>
There we saw this wondrous scene:<br>
There's an island far away–<br>
On this isle–a city gay;<br>
There, each dawn brings in new wonders:<br>
There, the ocean swells and thunders,<br>
Breakers, with a mighty roar,<br>
Foaming, flood its barren shore,<br>
Leaving, wonderful to see,<br>
Thirty stalwart knights and three<br>
All in mail a-gleaming bright<br>
Marching proudly left and right,<br>
Each one brave beyond compare<br>
Tall of stature, young and fair,<br>
All alike beyond belief;<br>
Hoary Chernomor, their chief,<br>
Marches with them from the deep,<br>
Counts them off, by twos, to keep<br>
Guard of this fair isle; and they<br>
Cease patrol nor night nor day.<br>
Nor can you find guards so true,<br>
Vigilant and fearless, too.<br>
Prince Guidon reigns there, and he<br>
Sends his compliments to thee."<br>
Here the tsar said, in amaze:<br>
"If but God prolong my days,<br>
I shall visit this strange isle,<br>
Guest with this Guidon a while."<br>
Silent were the cook and weaver.<br>
But their mother, sly deceiver,<br>
Said, as she smiled crookedly:<br>
"You may think this strange–not we!<br>
Fancy! Idle mermen play<br>
Sentry–go on land all day!<br>
Be this true, or but a lie,<br>
Nothing strange in this see I–<br>
Stranger things exist, mark you–<br>
This report, though, is quite true:<br>
There's a young princess, they say,<br>
That she charms all hearts away.<br>
Brighter than the sun at noon,<br>
She outshines the midnight moon,<br>
In her braids a crescent beams,<br>
On her brow, a bright star gleams.<br>
She herself is sweet of face.<br>
Full of majesty and grace.<br>
When she speaks, her voice doth seem<br>
Like the music of a stream.<br>
That's a wonder, now, for you–<br>
Marvelously strange, but true."<br>
Wisely, though, the guests prefer<br>
Not to bandy words with her.<br>
Tsar Saltan, he waxed most curious,<br>
Our tsarevich waxed most furious,<br>
But decided that he'd spare<br>
Granny's eyes for her gray hair.<br>
Buzzing like a bumble-bee,<br>
Round his granny circled he,<br>
Stung her nose with all his might,<br>
Raising blisters red and white.<br>
Panic once more filled the air:<br>
"Murder! catch that insect there!<br>
Help! O don't you let it go!<br>
Catch it!–hold it!–kill it!–O!<br>
O, you nasty insect, you!<br>
Just you wait!" Guidon, though, flew<br>
Through the casement, o'erthe main<br>
Back to his domain again.<br>
<br>
By the sea, the prince now paces,<br>
On the blue sea now he gazes,<br>
Suddenly, before Guidon<br>
Swam the graceful snow-white swan.<br>
"Greetings, my fair prince," said she<br>
"Why are you so sad, tell me?<br>
Why are you so dismal, say,<br>
Like a gloomy, cloudy day?"<br>
"Grief is gnawing at my breast,"<br>
Answered Prince Guidon, distressed<br>
"Every youth has his own bride–<br>
Only I unmarried bide."<br>
"Who is she you wish to wed?<br>
Tell me, now." Guidon then said:<br>
"There's a fair princess; they say<br>
That she charms both young and old–<br>
Brighter than the sun at noon,<br>
She outshines the midnight moon;<br>
In her braids, a crescent beams,<br>
On her brow, a bright star gleams.<br>
She herself is sweet of face,<br>
Full of majesty and grace.<br>
When she speaks, her sweet voice seems<br>
Like the flow of tinkling streams.<br>
Is this true, though, or a lie?"<br>
Anxiously, he waits reply.<br>
Silently, the snow-white swan<br>
Pondered; then she said: "Guidon–<br>
Yes–this maiden I can find;<br>
But a wife's no mitten, mind,<br>
From your lily hand to cast,<br>
Or unto your belt make fast;<br>
Listen now to my advice:<br>
Weigh this matter well–think twice,<br>
So that on your marriage morrow<br>
You do not repent in sorrow."<br>
Here Guidon with ardor swore<br>
That he'd thought of this before;<br>
That 'twas high time he was married,<br>
Too long single had he tarried;<br>
That for this princess so fair<br>
He would any perils dare,<br>
Sacrifice his very soul,<br>
Barefoot, walk right to the pole.<br>
Sighing thoughtfully, the swan<br>
Murmured: "Why so far, Guidon?<br>
Know, your future bride is here–<br>
I am that princess, my dear."<br>
Then she spread her wings, to soar<br>
O'er the waves towards the shore.<br>
There, amid a clump of trees,<br>
Folded them with graceful ease,<br>
Shook herself, and then and there<br>
Turned into a maiden fair–<br>
In her braids, a crescent beamed,<br>
On her brow, a bright star gleamed;<br>
She was sweet in form and face,<br>
Full of majesty and grace.<br>
When she spoke, her sweet voice seemed<br>
Like the flow of tinkling streams.<br>
He embraced the fair princess,<br>
Folded her unto his breast.<br>
Hand in hand with her he sped<br>
To his mother dear, and said,<br>
Falling on his bended knees:<br>
"Mother darling– if you please,<br>
I have chosen me a bride–<br>
She will be your love and pride,<br>
Your consent we crave to wed,<br>
And your blessing, too," he said–<br>
"Bless our marriage, so that we<br>
Live in love and harmony."<br>
O'er the kneeling pair, she stands,<br>
Holy icon in her hands,<br>
Smiling through her happy tears,<br>
Saying: "God bless you, my dears."<br>
Prince Guidon did not delay–<br>
They were married that same day,<br>
Settled down, a happy pair,<br>
Lacking nothing but an heir.<br>
<br>
Breezes o'er the ocean play,<br>
Speed a barque upon its way;<br>
Sails all spread, it skims the seas,<br>
Running swiftly 'fore the breeze,<br>
Past a craggy island, where<br>
Stands a city proud and fair.<br>
Cannons with a mighty roar<br>
Bid the merchants put to shore,<br>
When the merchants land, Guidon<br>
Bids them be his guests anon;<br>
Feasts them first with meat and wine,<br>
Then he says: "Now, masters mine–<br>
Tell me what you have for sale,<br>
Whither bound and whence you hail?"<br>
Said the merchants: "If you please,<br>
We have sailed the seven seas,<br>
Contraband, prince, was our ware,<br>
And our profits– rich and rare,<br>
We have far to travel yet–<br>
Homewards– East– our course is set,<br>
Past the Island of Buyan,<br>
Back to gracious Tsar Saltan."<br>
"Gentles," murmured Prince Guidon–<br>
"May fair breezes speed you on,<br>
O'er the ocean, o'er the main,<br>
Back to Tsar Saltan again.<br>
Pray remind your tsar from me,<br>
That his gracious majesty<br>
Said he'd visit us some day:<br>
We regret his long delay.<br>
Give him my regards." Thereon<br>
Off the merchants went. Guidon<br>
This time stayed with his fair bride,<br>
Never more to leave her side.<br>
<br>
Merrily the breeze is singing,<br>
O'er the waves a ship is winging<br>
Past the Island of Buyan<br>
To the realm of Tsar Saltan.<br>
Now his longed-for land, so dear,<br>
Stands out in the distance, clear.<br>
Now each merchant is the guest<br>
Of the tsar, by his behest.<br>
On his royal throne of state,<br>
Crowned in glory, there he sate,<br>
While the royal cook, and weaver,<br>
And their mother, sly deceiver,<br>
With four eyes, though they be three,<br>
Stared at him voraciously.<br>
Tsar Saltan, with royal grace,<br>
Gave the merchants each his place.<br>
Then he said: "Now, masters mine–<br>
Sailed you far across the brine?<br>
Are things well where you have been?<br>
What strange wonders have you seen?"<br>
Quoth the merchants: "If you please,<br>
We have sailed the seven seas.<br>
Peace reigns overseas, serene.<br>
There, we saw this wondrous scene:<br>
On an island, far away,<br>
Stands a city grand and gay–<br>
Churches tall with golden domes,<br>
Gardens green, and stately homes.<br>
Near its palace grows a fir<br>
In whose shade, O royal sir,<br>
Stands a crystal house; and there<br>
Dwells a squirrel strange and rare,<br>
Full of frolic; all day long,<br>
Cracking nuts, its sings a song.<br>
Nuts, most wondrous to bekold–<br>
Shells of purest yellow gold,<br>
All its kernels– emeralds bright.<br>
Sentries guard it day and night.<br>
There we saw another wonder–<br>
Every morn, the breakers thunder<br>
And the waves, with mighty roar,<br>
Overflow the barren shore,<br>
Leaving, wonderful to see,<br>
Thirty stalwart knights and three.<br>
Each one brave beyond compare,<br>
Tall of stature, young and fair.<br>
All in mail a-gleaming bright,<br>
Marching proudly left and right:<br>
All alike beyond belief,<br>
Led by Chernomor, their chief.<br>
Nor will you find guards so true,<br>
Vigilant and fearless, too.<br>
Prince Guidon reigns there in glory,<br>
He is praised in song and story.<br>
And his wife is fair, O sire–<br>
Gaze on her–you'll never tire.<br>
Brighter than the sun at noon,<br>
She outshines the midnight moon;<br>
In her braids, a crescent beams,<br>
On her brow, a bright star gleams.<br>
Prince Guidon sends his respects,<br>
Bade us say he still expects<br>
You to visit him one day<br>
And regrets your long delay."<br>
<br>
All impatient, Tsar Saltan<br>
Gave command his fleet to man,<br>
But the royal cook, and weaver,<br>
And their mother, sly deceiver,<br>
Did their best to keep their tsar<br>
From this wondrous isle so far.<br>
He, to their persuasions deaf,<br>
Bade the women hold their breath.<br>
"I'm your tsar and not a child!"<br>
Shouted he in passion wild–<br>
"We will sail today. No more!"<br>
Stamped his foot and slammed the door.<br>
<br>
From his casement, silently,<br>
Prince Guidon gazed at the sea.<br>
Scarce a ripple stirred the deep<br>
As it sighed as though in sleep.<br>
On the far horizon blue<br>
Sails came one by one in view.<br>
Tsar Saltan's fleet, at long last,<br>
O'er the seas was sailing fast.<br>
At this sight, Guidon rushed out,<br>
Uttering a mighty shout:<br>
"Mother dear, come hither, do–<br>
You, my fair princess, come too–<br>
Only look out yonder–there<br>
Sails my father, I declare!"<br>
Through his spyglass, Prince Guidon<br>
Sees the royal fleet sail on;<br>
While on deck, his father stands,<br>
Spyglass also in his hands.<br>
With him are the cook, and weaver,<br>
And their mother, sly deceiver;<br>
Wonder in their gaze, they stare<br>
At this isle so strange and fair.<br>
In salute the cannons roared,<br>
Carols sweet from belfries soared.<br>
To the shore Guidon then ran,<br>
There to welcome Tsar Saltan,<br>
And the royal cook, and weaver,<br><br>
And their mother, sly deceiver.<br>
Citywards the tsar led he–<br>
Not a single word said he.<br>
<br>
Now the palace came in sight,<br>
Sentries, clad in armor bright.<br>
Tsar Saltan looked on to see<br>
Thirty stalwart knights and three–<br>
Each one brave beyond compare,<br>
Tall of stature, young and fair,<br>
All alike beyond belief,<br>
Led by Chernomor, their chief.<br>
Then he reached the courtyard wide,<br>
Where a lofty fir he spied.<br>
In its shadow–lo, behold,<br>
Cracking nuts of solid gold,<br>
Sat a little squirrel, singing,<br>
Emeralds into sacklets flinging.<br>
Golden nutshells lay around<br>
On the spacious courtyard ground.<br>
Further on the guests now press,<br>
Meet the wonderful princess:<br>
In her braids, a crescent beams,<br>
On her brow, a bright star gleams;<br>
She is sweet of form and face,<br>
Full of majesty and grace,<br>
Tsar Saltan's own wife beside her.<br>
He gazed on and recognized her.<br>
And his heart began to leap,<br><br>
"Am I dreaming in my sleep?"<br>
Gasped the tsar in stark surprise,<br>
Tears a-streaming from his eyes,<br>
He embraced his wife in pride,<br>
Kissed his son, his son's fair bride;<br>
Then they all sat down to feast<br>
Where their laughter never ceased,<br>
While the cook, and royal weaver,<br>
And their mother, sly deceiver,<br>
Fled and hid beneath the stairs<br>
But were dragged out by their hairs.<br>
Weeping, each her crimes confessed,<br>
Begged forgiveness, beat her breast.<br>
So the tsar, in his great glee<br>
Sent them home across the sea,<br>
Late at night, with tipsy head,<br>
Tsar Saltan was put to bed.<br>
I drank beer and mead there–yet<br>
Only got my whiskers wet.<br>
<br>
