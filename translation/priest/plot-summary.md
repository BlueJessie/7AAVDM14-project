The poem tells about a lazy priest who was wandering around the market looking for a cheap worker. 
There he met Balda (Балда in Russian means a stupid or not very serious person) who agreed to work for a year without pay except that he could hit the priest three times on his forehead and cooked spelt for food. 
The priest of course agreed because he was very much of a cheapskate. 
But then after he had observed Balda at work, he saw that he was not only very patient and careful but also very strong. That worried the priest greatly and he started giving Balda impossible missions to accomplish. The Priest asks Balda to gather the fabricated debt from sea devils. 
Balda troubles the sea with the rope and forces devils to come out. 
Devils agree to pay the debt if Balda will defeat them in running and weight carrying. 
Balda tricks the devils, allowing the rabbit (his proclaimed "younger brother") to run instead him, 
and "carrying" the horse between two legs by riding on it. 
The story ends when Balda gives the priest three blows to the forehead which results in 
the priest losing his mind. The final line is "You shouldn't have gone rushing off after cheapness."
