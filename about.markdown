This archive is a collection of fairy tales that were written by Alexander Pushkin. We are aiming to collect existing “free-to-use” translations, especially in verse. Alexander Pushkin is still a key figure in Russian literature. Even though there are only 5 fairy tales by him, these creations are known and loved by Russians since childhood. We want this archive to give an opportunity to non-Russian speakers to dive into the magical world of Pushkin’s tales.
