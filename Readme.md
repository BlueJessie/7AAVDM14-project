## General Info
***
This project was created as a part of the 7AAVDM14 The Cultural Web: Building a Humanities Website course at King's College London. It is a digital humanities website displaying cultural content. In particular, the focus of the current website is an archive of fairy tales of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The website is built using the Jekyll static site generator hosted on Github Pages. 

Alexander Pushkin was a Russian poet and novelist. He is known as his country's greatest poet and is still considered to be a key figure in Russian literature. During his career, Alexander Pushkin tried to write in different genres, including fairy tales. Only five of his fairy tales were published, however, they are widely known and loved by Russians since childhood.

This archive is a collection of fairy tales that were written by Alexander Pushkin. The original texts of the poems are provided along with the existing “free-to-use” translations, especially in verse. This archive aims to give an opportunity to non-Russian speakers to dive into the magical world of Pushkin’s tales.

The website is currently deployed at this address: https://pushkin-fairytales.netlify.app/about/
